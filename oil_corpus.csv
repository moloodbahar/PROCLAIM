Formation Evaluation,"The value a in the relation of formation factor (F) to porosity (phi): F = a / phim. The value a is derived empirically from best fits of measured values of F and phi on a group of rock samples. It has no clear physical significance, although it has been related to grain shape and tortuosity. In the saturation equation, it always occurs associated with the water resistivity as (a * Rw). It is sometimes claimed that a must be 1 since at phi = 1, F must be 1. However, a material with phi = 1 is not a rock: a is essentially an empirical factor for rocks and as such can take any value. A wide range of values has been found, from 0.5 to 5.",a

Polymers from 0.75 to 1.5 MM molecular weight are suggested for fluid-loss control in these difficult muds.Reference:Perricone AC, Enright DP and Lucas JM: Vinyl Sulfonate Copolymers for High-Temperature Filtration Control of Water-Base Muds, SPE Drilling Engineering 1, no. 5 (October 1986): 358-364.",acrylamido methyl propane sulfonate polymer
Geophysics,"Variation in seismic reflection amplitude with change in distance between shotpoint and receiver that indicates differences in lithology and fluid content in rocks above and below the reflector. AVO analysis is a technique by which geophysicists attempt to determine thickness, porosity, density, velocity, lithology and fluid content of rocks. Successful AVO analysis requires special processing of seismic data and seismic modeling to determine rock properties with a known fluid content. With that knowledge, it is possible to model other types of fluid content. A gas-filled sandstone might show increasing amplitude with offset, whereas a coal might show decreasing amplitude with offset. A limitation of AVO analysis using only P-energy is its failure to yield a unique solution, so AVO results are prone to misinterpretation. One common misinterpretation is the failure to distinguish a gas-filled reservoir from a reservoir having only partial gas saturation (fizz water). However, AVO analysis using source-generated or mode-converted shear wave energy allows differentiation of degrees of gas saturation. AVO analysis is more successful in young, poorly consolidated rocks, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico, than in older, well-cemented sediments.",amplitude variation with offset

Drilling Fluids,"Linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+. The acrylic acid groups are evenly spaced along the chain. Acrylic acid polymer neutralized with NaOH is sodium polyacrylate (SPA). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup. The polymer chain links together colloidal solids that can be removed by gravity settling in shallow pits or by applying hydrocyclone, centrifuge or filtration techniques.",acrylate polymer

Drilling Fluids,"A compound of sulfur that contains the S-2 ion. Sulfides can be generated from soluble iron sulfide minerals or from sulfate-reducing bacteria. The term active sulfide is used to denote compounds that revert to the highly toxic H2S gas when acidified with 2-molar citric acid solution, as opposed to inert sulfide, which is stable. Active sulfides include calcium sulfide and bisulfide formed when H2S reacts with lime in an oil-base mud. Their accumulation constitutes a safety concern at the rig because of the risk of reverting to H2S gas should an acidic influx occur. They may be converted to inert sulfides by adding zinc oxide.

Geology,"A subsurface condition in which the pore pressure of a geologic formation exceeds or is less than the expected, or normal, formation pressure. When impermeable rocks such as shales are compacted rapidly, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to abnormally high formation pressures. Excess pressure, called overpressure or geopressure, can cause a well to blowout or become uncontrollable during drilling. Severe underpressure can cause the drillpipe to stick to the underpressured formation.",abnormal pressure
Drilling,"Reservoir pore fluid pressure that is not similar to normal saltwater gradient pressure. The term is usually associated with higher than normal pressure, increased complexity for the well designer and an increased risk of well control problems. Pressure gradients in excess of around 10 pounds per gallon equivalent fluid density (0.52 psi/foot of depth) are considered abnormal. Gradients below normal are commonly called subnormal.",abnormal pressure
Drilling Fluids,"The escaping tendency, or vapor pressure, of water molecules in an aqueous solution compared with that of pure water, typically abbreviated aw. Activity is expressed mathematically as the ratio of two vapor pressures: aw = p/po, where p is vapor pressure of the solution and po is vapor pressure of pure water. The ratio ranges from near 0 to 1.0 and corresponds to percent relative humidity (% RH) of air in equilibrium with the aqueous solution. For pure water, aw = po/po = 1.00 and RH = 100%. By increasing the concentration of salt (or other solutes) in the solution, aw decreases, because vapor pressure of the solution decreases. However, aw never reaches zero. Known-activity, saturated-salt solutions are used to calibrate RH meters. Measuring RH of air above an oil mud is a simple way to measure the activity (salinity) of its water phase. Adjusting the salinity of the water phase is a way to control movement of water into or out of shales that are being drilled with an oil mud. Chenevert related aw in oil mud to RH above the mud sample and devised a practical test using an electrohygrometer to measure RH, called the Chenevert Method.",activity of aqueous solutions
Reservoir Characterization,A mathematical method of finding a central value for a group of data. It is most often referred to as the average but also as the mean. The arithmetic mean is the sum of all the observed values divided by the number of observations.,arithmetic mean
Drilling Fluids,"A laboratory test to evaluate drilling-grade weighting material for potential abrasiveness. The test measures weight loss of a specially shaped, stainless-steel mixer blade after 20 minutes at 11,000 rpm running in a laboratory-prepared mud sample. Abrasiveness is quantified by the rate of weight loss, reported in units of mg/min. Mineral hardness, particle size and shape are the main parameters that affect abrasiveness of weighting materials. Some crystalline forms of hematite grind to a higher percentage of large particles than do other forms and are therefore more abrasive. Hematites are harder than barites, grind courser and are more abrasive. Thus, a hematite that is proposed as a weighting material for mud is typically a candidate for abrasion testing.",abrasion test
Drilling Fluids,"One of a group of organic compounds of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) in which the carbon atoms have linear, branched chain (open), or both types of structures. Aliphatics, as they are informally called, can be divided into paraffinic (saturated) and olefinic (unsaturated) chain types. The simplest paraffinic aliphatic is methane, CH4. The simplest olefinic aliphatic is ethylene, C2H6. In drilling fluids, particularly oil-base muds, the amounts and types of hydrocarbon in the mud can be an important parameter in overall performance of the mud.",acyclic compound
Geophysics,"The acute angle at which a wavefront impinges upon an interface, such as a seismic wave impinging upon strata.

Well Workover and Intervention,"A wellbore treatment in which a fluid laden with solid particles is used to remove deposits from the surface of wellbore tubulars and completion components. The treatment fluid is pumped at high pressure through a downhole tool equipped with nozzles that direct a jet, or jets, of fluid onto the target area. Most tool designs use a controlled rotary motion to ensure complete circumferential treatment of internal surfaces. Abrasive jetting techniques can also be used to cut completion or wellbore components. For this application, highly abrasive particles, such as sand, are carried in a fluid and jetted at the target area over an extended period to erode the tubular.",abrasive jetting
Geophysics,"The acute angle at which a raypath impinges upon a line normal to an interface, such as a seismic wave impinging upon strata.

Drilling Fluids,"One of two quantitative analysis procedures for measuring aromatic content of base oils for use in oil mud as proscribed by the API. Results of the two aromatic content tests may differ because of the way the two gas-chromatography techniques separate and identify aromatics. The Institute of Petroleum (IP) instruments are more widely available than the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) instruments, and the Institute of Petroleum method measures trace levels better than the more complex ASTM method.",aromatic content test
Geology,"The measurement of age in years. The determination of the absolute age of rocks, minerals and fossils, in years before the present, is the basis for the field of geochronology. The measurement of the decay of radioactive isotopes, especially uranium, strontium, rubidium, argon and carbon, has allowed geologists to more precisely determine the age of rock formations. Tree rings and seasonal sedimentary deposits called varves can be counted to determine absolute age. Although the term implies otherwise, absolute ages typically have some amount of potential error and are inexact. Relative age, in contrast, is the determination of whether a given material is younger or older than other surrounding material on the basis of stratigraphic and structural relationships, such as superposition, or by interpretation of fossil content.",absolute age
Reservoir Characterization,"A property of semivariogram models. Any linear combination of admissible models with positive coefficients can be nested or added together. Generally, single models are used for modeling experimental semivariograms that are close in shape to one of the basic admissible models, or for the approximate fitting of complex structural functions. Nested models are used to better fit complex structural functions.

Drilling Fluids,"A type of compound containing hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a symmetrical 6-carbon ring structure with single (C-C) and double (C=C) bonds alternating around the ring. Rings are single, multiple or fused and can have other chemical groups attached in place of hydrogen. Benzene, C6H6 is the simplest single-ring aromatic, napthalene, C10H8, the simplest fused-ring aromatic and toluene is the simplest aromatic, having an alkyl side chain, C6H5-CH3. Xylene, a common oilfield chemical, has two methyl side chains, C6H4-(CH3)2. Aniline is the simplest aromatic amine, C6H5-NH2 and is used in the aniline point test. Aromatic hydrocarbons in oils used to prepare oil-base mud can damage elastomers and increase the toxicity of the fluid. The aniline point test is used for screening oils to infer aromatic content.",aromatic hydrocarbon
Well Workover and Intervention,"A type of high-specification fluid filter frequently used to remove small solid particles from workover or treatment fluids that may be injected into, or placed adjacent to, the reservoir formation.

Well Testing,"The flow associated with wellbore storage following a surface shut-in. When a well is first shut in at the surface, flow from the formation into the bottom of the wellbore continues unabated until compression of the fluids in the wellbore causes the downhole pressure to rise. If the wellbore fluid is highly compressible and the well rate is low, the afterflow period can be long. Conversely, high-rate wells producing little gas have negligible afterflow periods.",afterflow
Drilling,"A flow of formation gas in the annulus between a casing string and the borehole wall. Annular gas flows occur when there is insufficient hydrostatic pressure to restrain the gas. They can occur in uncemented intervals and even in cemented sections if the cement bond is poor. After cementing, as the cement begins to harden, a gel-like structure forms that effectively supports the solid material in the cement slurry. However, during this initial gelling period, the cement has no appreciable strength. Hence, with the solid (weighting) material now supported by the gel structure, the effective density of the slurry that the reservoir experiences falls rather suddenly to the density of the mix water of the cement, which is usually fresh water, whose density is 8.34 lbm/gal, or a gradient of 0.434 psi/ft of vertical column height.

Formation Evaluation,"With reference to invasion, a region between the flushed zone and the undisturbed zone containing a buildup of formation water. The annulus forms during invasion and is caused by the different mobilities of oil and water. It only occurs in the presence of both, but is unstable and will dissipate vertically or horizontally with time. The annulus has approximately the same water saturation as the flushed zone but contains formation water. When the formation water is much more saline than the mud filtrate, the annulus forms a conductive ring around the borehole. This conductivity will cause an induction log to read too low a resistivity, by an amount that depends on its depth of investigation and the radius of the annulus. (Laterologs are little affected since they respond to resistivity, not conductivity.) Often a medium log will be more affected than a deep log so that an annulus can be detected by out-of-order curves (medium curves reading less than either shallow or deep). Array induction logs contain enough information to solve and correct for the effect of the annulus.",annulus

The density of gas-cut mud can be measured accurately using a pressurized mud balance. Defoamer chemicals added to the mud or a mechanical vacuum pump degasser can liberate the trapped gas. The derrickman periodically measures mud density and communicates the results to the driller via an intercom, typically reporting something like 9.6 heavy, 10.4, or 13.2 light, indicating more than 9.6 pounds per gallon, 10.4 pounds per gallon, or less than 13.2 pounds per gallon, respectively. Each tenth of a pound per gallon is referred to as a point of mud weight. Note that for this low-accuracy measurement, no direct mention of gas cut is made. A gas cut is inferred only if the mud returning to the surface is significantly less dense than it should be.

May be the measurement of the difference between an observed or measured value and the expected values of a physical property. Anomalies can be of great interest in hydrocarbon and mineral exploration because they often indicate hydrocarbon and mineral prospects and accumulations, such as geologic structures like folds and faults.

Drilling," Drilling Fluids,A drilling fluid (or mud) that has gas (air or natural gas) bubbles in it, resulting in a lower bulk, unpressurized density compared with a mud not cut by gas. The density of gas-cut mud can be measured accurately using a pressurized mud balance. Defoamer chemicals added to the mud or a mechanical vacuum pump degasser can liberate the trapped gas. The derrickman periodically measures mud density and communicates the results to the driller via an intercom, typically reporting something like 9.6 heavy, 10.4, or 13.2 light, indicating more than 9.6 pounds per gallon, 10.4 pounds per gallon, or less than 13.2 pounds per gallon, respectively. Each tenth of a pound per gallon is referred to as a point of mud weight. Note that for this low-accuracy measurement, no direct mention of gas cut is made. A gas cut is inferred only if the mud returning to the surface is significantly less dense than it should be. In the case of the mud logger's measurement, units of gas (having virtually no absolute meaning) are reported.

A similar recording is made of the wave from a second dipole transmitter, mounted orthogonally to the first. The flexural-wave velocity is closely related to the formation shear velocity, particularly at low frequencies and in hard formations. Using all four waveforms, the Alford rotation is used to determine the speed and direction of the fast and the slow shear wave.

Formation Evaluation,"The unit of radioactivity used for natural gamma ray logs. This unit is based on an artificially radioactive concrete block at the University of Houston, Texas, USA, that is defined to have a radioactivity of 200 American Petroleum Institute (API) units. This was chosen because it was considered to be twice the radioactivity of a typical shale. The formation is the primary standard for calibrating gamma ray logs. However, even when properly calibrated, different gamma ray tools will not necessarily have identical readings downhole because their detectors can have different spectral sensitivities. They will read the same only if the downhole formation contains the same proportions of thorium, potassium and uranium as the Houston standard. For example, logging while drilling (LWD) tools have thicker housings than wireline tools, causing a different spectral response to the three sources of radioactivity, and therefore a different total gamma ray reading in some formations.

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for combining a measurement that has a high accuracy but low precision with another measurement of the same quantity that has a high precision but low accuracy in order to produce a result that is better than either alone. Alpha processing is used to improve the vertical resolution of neutron porosity and other dual-detector nuclear logs. The detector near the source has better precision than the far detector in the sense that it responds more precisely to vertical changes. However, the near detector is less accurate because it is more affected by the borehole environment. Alpha processing mathematically superimposes the rapid changes of the near detector on the slowly changing but accurate far detector to produce an accurate log with high vertical resolution. The technique is also used to improve results from the carbon-oxygen log and other pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurements. Two methods are used to determine the carbon/oxygen ratio. The windows method counts the number of gamma rays within energy windows placed at the main peaks for carbon and oxygen. This method has good statistical precision but poor accuracy, as gamma rays from other elements contaminate these windows. The other method, spectral stripping, compares the total spectrum against standards for many elements, inverting the spectrum to obtain the yield for each element. This method is more accurate but has less statistical precision. Averaging over a number of measurements, alpha processing adjusts the windows result with the more accurate spectral stripping in order to obtain a precise and accurate result.",alpha processing

To measure the formation velocity, it may be necessary to use a sonic logging tool that has a greater spacing between transmitter and receiver array (about 10 to 15 ft [3 to 4.5 m]) than the standard sonic tool (about 3 to 5 ft [0.9 to 1.5 m]). The altered zone may also give rise to different acoustic modes, for example the hybrid mode or a second Stoneley wave.",altered zone

Geophysics,"Abbreviation for amplitude variation with offset. Variation in seismic reflection amplitude with change in distance between shotpoint and receiver that indicates differences in lithology and fluid content in rocks above and below the reflector. AVO analysis is a technique by which geophysicists attempt to determine thickness, porosity, density, velocity, lithology and fluid content of rocks. Successful AVO analysis requires special processing of seismic data and seismic modeling to determine rock properties with a known fluid content. With that knowledge, it is possible to model other types of fluid content. A gas-filled sandstone might show increasing amplitude with offset, whereas a coal might show decreasing amplitude with offset. A limitation of AVO analysis using only P-energy is its failure to yield a unique solution, so AVO results are prone to misinterpretation. One common misinterpretation is the failure to distinguish a gas-filled reservoir from a reservoir having only partial gas saturation (fizz water). However, AVO analysis using source-generated or mode-converted shear wave energy allows differentiation of degrees of gas saturation. AVO analysis is more successful in young, poorly consolidated rocks, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico, than in older, well-cemented sediments.",AVO
Geophysics,"The rate at which a sound wave travels through a medium. Unlike the physicist's definition of velocity as a vector, its usage in geophysics is as a property of a medium: distance divided by traveltime. Velocity can be determined from laboratory measurements, acoustic logs, vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. It can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media such as rocks, and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant-velocity (homogeneous) medium.",acoustic velocity

Formation Evaluation,"A calculation of the properties of the solid fraction of a rock from the combination of two logs. For example, by combining the density and neutron porosity measurements, it is possible to compute an apparent matrix density; by combining neutron porosity and sonic measurement, it is possible to compute an apparent matrix traveltime. The computations assume a particular fluid, usually fresh water, and particular response equations. The results are often displayed as quicklook logs for lithology identification.

Formation Evaluation,"A wireline log of the concentration by weight of aluminum in the formation, based on the principle of neutron activation. Aluminum (27Al) can be activated by capturing relatively low-energy neutrons from a chemical source to produce the isotope 28Al, which decays with a half-life of 2.3 minutes and emits a relatively easily detected 1.78 MeV gamma ray. A natural gamma ray spectrometer will detect this gamma ray along with the other natural gamma rays. If the natural gamma spectrum has been measured before activation, it can be subtracted from the spectrum after activation to give an estimate of Al content. Al is a relatively direct indicator of the volume of clay, since clay minerals are alumino-silicates.",aluminum activation log

Geophysics,"The generation and recording of seismic data. Acquisition involves many different receiver configurations, including laying geophones or seismometers on the surface of the Earth or seafloor, towing hydrophones behind a marine seismic vessel, suspending hydrophones vertically in the sea or placing geophones in a wellbore (as in a vertical seismic profile) to record the seismic signal. A source, such as a vibrator unit, dynamite shot, or an air gun, generates acoustic or elastic vibrations that travel into the Earth, pass through strata with different seismic responses and filtering effects, and return to the surface to be recorded as seismic data. Optimal acquisition varies according to local conditions and involves employing the appropriate source (both type and intensity), optimal configuration of receivers, and orientation of receiver lines with respect to geological features. This ensures that the highest signal-to-noise ratio can be recorded, resolution is appropriate, and extraneous effects such as air waves, ground roll, multiples and diffractions can be minimized or distinguished, and removed through processing.",acquisition

Percussion detonators contain abrasive grit and primary high explosive in a sealed container that is activated by a firing pin. The impact force of the firing pin is sufficient to initiate the ballistic sequence that is then transmitted to the detonating cord.

Drilling,"To unscrew drillstring components downhole. The drillstring, including drillpipe and the bottomhole assembly, are coupled by various threadforms known as connections, or tool joints. Often when a drillstring becomes stuck it is necessary to back off the string as deep as possible to recover as much of the string as possible. To facilitate the fishing or recovery operation, the backoff is usually accomplished by applying reverse torque and detonating an explosive charge inside a selected threaded connection. The force of the explosion enlarges the female (outer) thread enough that the threaded connection unscrews instantly. A torqueless backoff may be performed as well. In that case, tension is applied, and the threads slide by each other without turning when the explosive detonates. Backing off can also occur unintentionally.",back off

Drilling,"Large capacity self-locking wrenches used to grip drillstring components and apply torque. The breakout tongs are the active tongs during breakout operations. A similar set of tongs is tied off to a deadline anchor during breakout operations to provide backup to the connection, not unlike the way a plumber uses two pipe wrenches in an opposing manner to tighten or loosen water pipes, except that breakout tongs are much larger.",breakout tongs
Drilling,"To unscrew drillstring components downhole. The drillstring, including drillpipe and the bottomhole assembly, are coupled by various threadforms known as connections, or tool joints. Often when a drillstring becomes stuck it is necessary to back off the string as deep as possible to recover as much of the string as possible. To facilitate the fishing or recovery operation, the backoff is usually accomplished by applying reverse torque and detonating an explosive charge inside a selected threaded connection. The force of the explosion enlarges the female (outer) thread enough that the threaded connection unscrews instantly. A torqueless backoff may be performed as well. In that case, tension is applied, and the threads slide by each other without turning when the explosive detonates. Backing off can also occur unintentionally. Synonyms: break out",backoff

Drilling,"An uncontrolled flow of reservoir fluids into the wellbore, and sometimes catastrophically to the surface. A blowout may consist of salt water, oil, gas or a mixture of these. Blowouts occur in all types of exploration and production operations, not just during drilling operations.

BOPs come in a variety of styles, sizes and pressure ratings. Some can effectively close over an open wellbore, some are designed to seal around tubular components in the well (drillpipe, casing or tubing) and others are fitted with hardened steel shearing surfaces that can actually cut through drillpipe. Since BOPs are critically important to the safety of the crew, the rig and the wellbore itself, BOPs are inspected, tested and refurbished at regular intervals determined by a combination of risk assessment, local practice, well type and legal requirements.

The gas is typically obtained from a suction line above the gas trap located immediately upstream of the shale shaker screens, where the gas evolves out of the mud. Oil-base mud systems tend to produce higher background gas values than do water-base muds. Deviations from the background gas trend likely indicate changes in porosity or permeability, or changes in drilling conditions; any of which merits further investigation.

For circulating wellbores, the BHP increases by the amount of fluid friction in the annulus. The BHP gradient should exceed the formation pressure gradient to avoid an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore.

Well Workover and Intervention,"A technique used in the assembly of coiled tubing strings at the manufacturing plant. Prior to being formed, the string is assembled from flat steel strips joined by a bias weld that is angled across the strip joint at 45 degrees. When the tubing string is milled, the helical weld form provides enhanced characteristics of the tube at the weld site. These are significantly better than those achievable with the alternative butt weld technique.",bias weld
Drilling,"A large valve at the top of a well that may be closed if the drilling crew loses control of formation fluids. By closing this valve (usually operated remotely via hydraulic actuators), the drilling crew usually regains control of the reservoir, and procedures can then be initiated to increase the mud density until it is possible to open the BOP and retain pressure control of the formation. BOPs come in a variety of styles, sizes and pressure ratings. Some can effectively close over an open wellbore, some are designed to seal around tubular components in the well (drillpipe, casing or tubing) and others are fitted with hardened steel shearing surfaces that can actually cut through drillpipe. Since BOPs are critically important to the safety of the crew, the rig and the wellbore itself, BOPs are inspected, tested and refurbished at regular intervals determined by a combination of risk assessment, local practice, well type and legal requirements. BOP tests vary from daily function testing on critical wells to monthly or less frequent testing on wells thought to have low probability of well control problems.",BOP
Production Logging,"The frequency with which a local probe detects a change from one type of fluid to another. For example, if water is the continuous phase, the probe will respond digitally each time a bubble of oil or gas passes it. The average frequency of change is the bubble count rate, or bubble count. In this example, an increasing bubble count means an increasing oil or gas velocity. Bubble velocity can be calculated from bubble count and bubble size, the latter being estimated from an empirical correlation with water holdup. The depth at which the first bubbles are counted is a sensitive indicator of the lowest hydrocarbon entry. Since the bubble count is based on local probe measurements, both bubble count and bubble velocity can be presented as images, similar to the holdup image.",bubble count
Well Workover and Intervention,"A condition that may occur during ball diversion treatments in which all open perforations capable of receiving fluid are sealed. Ballout is signified by a rapid increase in treating pressure. Maintaining the treatment pressure may result in the breakdown and subsequent treatment of plugged perforations.

Drilling,"A set of two or more BOPs used to ensure pressure control of a well. A typical stack might consist of one to six ram-type preventers and, optionally, one or two annular-type preventers. A typical stack configuration has the ram preventers on the bottom and the annular preventers at the top. The configuration of the stack preventers is optimized to provide maximum pressure integrity, safety and flexibility in the event of a well control incident. For example, in a multiple ram configuration, one set of rams might be fitted to close on 5-in. diameter drillpipe, another set configured for 4 1/2-in. drillpipe, a third fitted with blind rams to close on the openhole and a fourth fitted with a shear ram that can cut and hang-off the drillpipe as a last resort. It is common to have an annular preventer or two on the top of the stack since annulars can be closed over a wide range of tubular sizes and the openhole, but are typically not rated for pressures as high as ram preventers. The BOP stack also includes various spools, adapters and piping outlets to permit the circulation of wellbore fluids under pressure in the event of a well control incident.",BOP stack
Geophysics,"Bubble pulses or bubble noise that affect data quality. In marine seismic acquisition, the gas bubble produced by an air gun oscillates and generates subsequent pulses that cause source-generated noise.

Production Logging,"A multiphase flow regime in pipes in which one fluid moves as small dispersed bubbles through a continuous fluid. The relative velocity of the bubbles depends mainly on the difference in density between the two fluids. Bubble flow normally occurs at low flow rate and low holdup of the bubbly fluid. As the velocity of the continuous fluid increases, the bubbles are dispersed into smaller, more widely separated bubbles. This is known as a dispersed or finely dispersed bubble flow, or sometimes dispersed flow.",bubble flow

At discovery, all petroleum reservoir oils contain some natural gas in solution. Often the oil is saturated with gas when discovered, meaning that the oil is holding all the gas it can at the reservoir temperature and pressure, and that it is at its bubblepoint. Occasionally, the oil will be undersaturated. In this case, as the pressure is lowered, the pressure at which the first gas begins to evolve from the oil is defined as the bubblepoint.",bubble point

Formation Evaluation,"An upgoing and downgoing arrangement of transducers in a logging tool, largely to offset spurious changes in reading caused by variations in borehole size or sonde tilt. The technique is used for measurements that rely on the propagation of a wave, such as sonic, propagation resistivity and electromagnetic propagation measurement. Propagation logs rely on measuring the difference in properties of a wave at two receivers. The borehole influences this difference if the tool is tilted or if there is a cave opposite one of the receivers. The effect can be compensated for by using two transmitters that radiate sequentially in opposite directions. In ideal conditions, the effect of a tilt or a cave is exactly opposite for the two transmitters, so that an average gives the correct result. Borehole compensation is different from borehole correction.",borehole compensation

Formation Evaluation,"The amount by which a log measurement must be adjusted in order to remove the contribution of the borehole. Although most log measurements are designed to pick up a minimum of signal from the borehole, some contribution usually remains. This contribution may be removed by software or by manual entry into correction charts. In resistivity logging, the correction replaces the borehole with a resistivity equal to that of the formation. In nuclear logging, the correction adjusts the reading to that which would be found in a standard condition, such as an 8-in. [20-cm] borehole filled with fresh water.",borehole correction

Perforating,"A perforating charge designed to create perforations with a large-diameter entrance hole. These charges typically are used in sand control completions, in which efficient placement of the gravel pack treatment within the perforation tunnel is crucial. Altering the explosive charge design and materials creates a larger diameter entrance hole on the perforation while reducing the depth of penetration. However, gravel-pack treatments generally are applied in high-permeability formations where perforation tunnel length is less important. Wells that are to be hydraulically fractured also can benefit from larger perforations since the effective penetration is significantly increased by a high-conductivity fracture.",big hole charge
Formation Evaluation,"Pertaining to the detection of the Earth's gravitational field within a wellbore. Subtle vertical variations of the Earth's gravity field may be detected over the length of a borehole. These depend on the variations in the formation density not only above and below the sensor, but also laterally away from the borehole. Thus, borehole gravity measurements may be used to detect the following phenomena: - overburden pressure - lateral formation density changes arising from porosity changes away from the borehole (fracture fields, vugs) - lateral proximity to lithology changes, such as major faulting or salt intrusions - time-lapse density measurements to monitor fluid saturation changes during the life of a reservoir. In borehole gravity measurements, highly accurate formation density measurements, averaged over a large volume, may be made by comparing changes of gravity between measurement stations.",borehole gravity

Drilling Fluids,"A type of mud that contains the three components that form a chemical buffer, whether by design or by coincidence. Buffering results from components that react with the added OH- ions (or added H+ ions) forming slightly soluble or slightly ionized compounds. Water is one component of a buffer and various ions are the other components, such as bicarbonates, carbonates, lignite, lignosulfonate, silicate and sulfide. Clay solids are buffers because of their ability to accept or donate H+ ions on their surface. The pH of a buffered mud will not increase as fast as expected after addition of caustic soda, for example.",buffered mud
Formation Evaluation,"The electromagnetic force created by two different metals in contact with each other. If two such metals are in contact in a logging tool, and also communicate along a conductive borehole, then a potential drop is generated in the borehole. This potential drop will appear on the spontaneous potential (SP) log, where it can be confused with the electrochemical potential. Since the magnitude of the drop depends on the formation resistivity, the effect of bimetallism is often seen as a resistivity log superimposed on the normal SP. Under usual circumstances, the effect of bimetallism on the SP is small, and care is taken to avoid it.",bimetallism

Drilling Fluids,"A two-parameter rheological model widely used in the drilling fluids industry to describe flow characteristics of many types of muds. It can be described mathematically as follows: τ = YP + PV(γ), where τ = shear stress γ = shear rate YP = yield point PV = plastic viscosity. Fluids obeying this model are called Bingham plastic fluids and exhibit a linear shear-stress, shear-rate behavior after an initial shear stress threshold has been reached. Plastic viscosity (PV) is the slope of the line and yield point (YP) is the threshold stress. PV should be as low as possible for fast drilling and is best achieved by minimizing colloidal solids. YP must be high enough to carry cuttings out of the hole, but not so large as to create excessive pump pressure when starting mud flow. YP is adjusted by judicious choices of mud treatments. The direct-indicating rotational rheometer was specifically designed to apply the Bingham plastic fluid model.",Bingham plastic model

Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the loss of coherent energy by hydrogen atoms as they interact with each other in bulk fluids. Bulk relaxation in fluids is caused primarily by fluctuating local magnetic fields arising from the random tumbling motion of neighboring molecules. Local field fluctuations may be high, but the fast movement of molecules tends to average these out. Thus the bulk relaxation depends strongly on the rate of movement and is affected by temperature and viscosity. In water-wet rocks, hydrocarbons do not touch the pore walls and are not affected by surface relaxation. Thus the T1 and T2 of hydrocarbons are the result only of bulk and diffusion relaxation. This is an important feature of NMR logging. Based on this feature, direct hydrocarbon-typing techniques have been developed for the detection and characterization of hydrocarbons.",bulk relaxation

Drilling,"To forcibly pump fluids into a formation, usually formation fluids that have entered the wellbore during a well control event. Though bullheading is intrinsically risky, it is performed if the formation fluids are suspected to contain hydrogen sulfide gas to prevent the toxic gas from reaching the surface. Bullheading is also performed if normal circulation cannot occur, such as after a borehole collapse. The primary risk in bullheading is that the drilling crew has no control over where the fluid goes and the fluid being pumped downhole usually enters the weakest formation. In addition, if only shallow casing is cemented in the well, the bullheading operation can cause wellbore fluids to broach around the casing shoe and reach the surface. This broaching to the surface has the effect of fluidizing and destabilizing the soil (or the subsea floor), and can lead to the formation of a crater and loss of equipment and life.",bullhead

This pressure may be calculated in a static, fluid-filled wellbore with the equation:BHP = MW * Depth * 0.052where BHP is the bottomhole pressure in pounds per square inch, MW is the mud weight in pounds per gallon, Depth is the true vertical depth in feet, and 0.052 is a conversion factor if these units of measure are used. For circulating wellbores, the BHP increases by the amount of fluid friction in the annulus. The BHP gradient should exceed the formation pressure gradient to avoid an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore.On the other hand, if BHP (including the added fluid friction pressure of a flowing fluid) is too high, a weak formation may fracture and cause a loss of wellbore fluids. The loss of fluid to one formation may be followed by the influx of fluid from another formation.",bottomhole pressure
Well Testing,"The pressure measured in a well at or near the depth of the producing formation.

Formation Evaluation,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv. In formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ. The multiple salinity and membrane potential methods are more direct measurements of the effect of CEC on formation resistivity and spontaneous potential.",base exchange
Drilling Fluids,"Quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral (or similar material) can accommodate on its negative charged surface, expressed as milliequivalents per 100 grams.

CEC for a mud sample is reported as MBC, methylene blue test (MBT) or bentonite equivalent, lbm/bbl or kg/m3.",base exchange
Formation Evaluation,"A theory for acoustic propagation in a porous and elastic medium developed by M.A. Biot. Compressional and shear velocities can be calculated by standard elastic theory from the composite density, shear and bulk modulus of the total rock. The problem is how to determine these from the properties of the constituent parts. Biot showed that the composite properties could be determined from the porosity and the elastic properties (density and moduli) of the fluid, the solid material, and the empty rock skeleton, or framework. To account for different frequencies of propagation, it is also necessary to know the frequency, the permeability of the rock, the viscosity of the fluid and a coefficient for the inertial drag between skeleton and fluid. Unlike the Gassmann model, the Biot theory takes into account frequency variations, and allows for relative motion between fluid and rock framework. As a result, it predicts some of the observed changes in velocity with frequency, as well as the critical frequency below which the Gassmann model is valid. It also predicts the existence of a so-called slow wave in addition to the shear wave and the compressional, or fast wave. The slow wave arises when the fluid and the skeleton move 1800 out-of-phase with each other. Its velocity is related to fluid mobility, but unfortunately has been observed only in the laboratory, not on logs. At logging frequencies, it degenerates into a diffusion phenomenon rather than a wave, and is apparently too highly attenuated to be observed in real rocks. However, in permeable formations, the Stoneley wave couples into the slow wave, causing the attenuation and dispersion that allow the measurement of Stoneley permeability. The full Biot theory is used mainly to analyze laboratory data. For practical log interpretation, it is more common to use the simpler Gassmann model.

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for measuring the bulk volume of a core sample by submerging it in a bath of mercury and observing the increase in weight of the bath, following Archimedes principle. The bulk volume is calculated from the increase in weight divided by the density of mercury at the temperature of the bath. The sample must not touch the side of the bath and be only a few millimeters below the surface. Mercury is used because it is so strongly nonwetting and therefore does not enter the pore space. Other, less toxic, liquids may be used in the bath, such as brine, refined oil or toluene. In this case, the sample must be fully saturated with the liquid before immersion. In an alternative method, the saturated sample is weighed in air and then again once immersed. The bulk volume is then the difference in weight divided by the density of the liquid used.",buoyancy method
Formation Evaluation,"The log used as the reference for depths in the well. Each log may record formation features at slightly different depths due to their different response and the difficulty of aligning depths. It is therefore important to select one log to which the other logs are depth matched, and which is used as the reference for well-to-well correlation and mechanical operations such as perforating.

In seismology, incident S-waves can exhibit birefringence as they split into a quasi-shear and a pure-shear wave. Although birefringence was first described by Danish physician Erasmus Bartholin (1625 to 1698) in crystals in 1669, the phenomenon was not fully understood until French physicist Etienne-Louis Malus (1775 to 1812) described polarized light in 1808.",birefringence

This high-velocity jet of fluid cleans both the bit teeth and the bottom of the hole. The sizes of the nozzles are usually measured in 1/32-in. increments (although some are recorded in millimeters), are always reported in thirty-seconds of size (i.e., fractional denominators are not reduced), and usually range from 6/32 to 32/32.",bit nozzle

Geophysics,"The adjustment to a measurement of gravitational acceleration to account for elevation and the density of rock between the measurement station and a reference level.

Formation Evaluation,"The resistivity measured at the drill bit by a measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tool. The bit resistivity measurement responds to resistivity changes as the bit penetrates the formation, or when the time after bit is zero. It is thus an early indication of formation change. The measurement is similar to a wireline electrode device except that toroids are used instead of electrodes. A transmitter toroid induces a low-frequency current in the drillstring, which flows out of the bit and returns farther up the string. The magnitude of the current depends on the resistivity near the bit, and is measured by another toroid. The vertical resolution and depth of investigation depend on the distances between the toroids and the bit, which, in turn, depend on the type of bottomhole assembly (BHA) used. The depth of investigation is sufficient that the effect of the borehole is normally small. The measurement is unfocused and usually not borehole-corrected. Since both bit and drillstring are in physical contact with the formation, it is possible to make the measurement in oil-base muds.",bit resistivity

Drilling Fluids,"A coring fluid formulated with components that are not likely to alter the wettability in the pores of the rock sample and that has low dynamic filtration characteristics. These qualities help retain the core's native properties and can retain some (or all) of the reservoir's fluids [water, oil and gas (gas only if kept under pressure)]. Bland water-base fluid is formulated to make the filtrate resemble the connate water in the reservoir. Keeping ionic composition and especially the pH matched to the reservoir water is most important. Thus, strong alkaline agents and clay deflocculants are avoided when designing bland coring fluids. Bland oil-base fluids should contain no water phase, and the base oil should resemble the reservoir oil. (Reservoir crude is used in some cases.) Amine, amide, phosphonated and sulfonated emulsifiers and the powerful oil-wetting agents are also avoided. Fatty acid soaps are chosen to emulsify the trace of water that is likely to be encountered. Additives that minimize dynamic filtration rate must be chosen. Setting mud density and bit hydraulics to give equivalent circulating density close to the reservoir pressure helps avoid filtrate invasion into the core. Designing core bits to core as fast as possible also limits filtrate invasion ahead of the bit.",bland coring fluid

Production Logging,"In a spinner flowmeter, the theoretical minimum fluid velocity required to initiate spinner rotation, assuming the spinner response is linear. In this sense, it is synonymous with threshold velocity. However, it is sometimes taken to mean the fluid velocity at which a significant amount of flow begins to leak past a basket flowmeter, sufficient to cause the response to be nonlinear.",bypass velocity

Reservoir Characterization,A grid pattern laid over a representation of fractures. The number of boxes that contain a fracture is counted and plotted against the box size on logarithmic scales. The slope of the line is equal to minus the fractal dimension. This is sometimes referred to as the box dimension.,box plots
Drilling Fluids,Mud that is left somewhere in the wellbore when some other fluid is pumped into the well. This can occur when pumping an oil mud into a well to displace a water mud. The bypassed water mud becomes a contaminant in the oil mud when it gets mixed into the circulating system. Drilling mud may be bypassed behind a casing or a liner when pumping cement into the casing or wellbore annular region. This mud-contaminated cement might not set up and might not isolate zones satisfactorily.,bypassed mud

Well Workover and Intervention,"A type of pump commonly used in the handling and mixing of oilfield fluids. The rotary motion of a profiled impeller in combination with a shaped pump housing or volute applies centrifugal force to discharge fluids from the pump. Centrifugal pumps generally operate most efficiently in high-volume, low-output-pressure conditions. Unlike a positive-displacement pump, the flow from centrifugal pumps can be controlled easily, even allowing flow to be completely closed off using valves on the pump discharge manifold while the pump is running. This pump is known as a centrifugal pump.",C pump
Well Completions,"A remedial cementing operation designed to force cement into leak paths in wellbore tubulars. The required squeeze pressure is achieved by carefully controlling pump pressure.

Corrosion coatings should possess flexibility, resistance against impact and moisture, good adhesion and cohesion, and chemical resistance to the exposure conditions (such as temperature, hydrogen sulfide). Organic coatings such as polyethylenes (plastic) are normally used for external protection of pipelines while asphalt and coal tar enamels are used to protect buried pipes or undersides of oilfield tanks. Inorganic coating such as zinc-silicate is used to protect drilling and production platforms above the splash zone and nickel phosphate coating is used to protect packer body parts.",coating
Well Completions,An artificial-lift method in which the gas-lift system is operated on a continuous basis to sustain liquid production at an efficient rate.,continuous gas lift
Drilling,"An electromechanical device used to connect an electrical tool string to a logging cable, electrical wireline or coiled tubing string equipped with an electrical conductor. It provides attachments to both the mechanical armor wires (which give logging cable its tensile strength) and the outer mechanical housing of a logging tool, usually by means of threads. This connection to the logging tool results in a good electrical path from the electrical conductors of the logging cable to the electrical contacts of the logging tool, and shields this electrical path from contact with conductive fluids, such as certain drilling muds. The basic requirements of most cable heads include providing reliable electrical and mechanical connectivity between the running string and tool string. Another attribute of cable heads is that they serve as a weak link, so that if a logging tool becomes irretrievably stuck in a well, the operator may intentionally pull in excess of the breaking strength of the logging cable head, causing the cable to pull out of the cable head in a controlled fashion.",cable head
Formation Evaluation,"The exponent of porosity, m, in the relation of formation factor, F, to porosity, phi. In the Archie equation, F = 1 / phim, H.

Drilling Fluids,The continuous phase of an emulsion. The internal phase is the dispersed droplets of emulsified fluid.,continuous phase
Drilling,"A method of drilling whereby an impact tool or bit, suspended in the well from a steel cable, is dropped repeatedly on the bottom of the hole to crush the rock. The tool is usually fitted with some sort of cuttings basket to trap the cuttings along the side of the tool. After a few impacts on the bottom of the hole, the cable is reeled in and the cuttings basket emptied, or a bailer is used to remove cuttings from the well. The tool is reeled back to the bottom of the hole and the process repeated. Due to the increasing time required to retrieve and deploy the bit as the well is deepened, the cable-tool method is limited to shallow depths. Though largely obsolete, cable-tool operations are still used to drill holes for explosive charge placement (such as for acquisition of surface seismic data) and water wells.",cable tool drilling

Drilling Fluids," Formation Evaluation,The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",cake
Drilling,"To prepare and pump cement into place in a wellbore. Cementing operations may be undertaken to seal the annulus after a casing string has been run, to seal a lost circulation zone, to set a plug in an existing well from which to push off with directional tools or to plug a well so that it may be abandoned. Before cementing operations commence, engineers determine the volume of cement (commonly with the help of a caliper log) to be placed in the wellbore and the physical properties of both the slurry and the set cement needed, including density and viscosity. A cementing crew uses special mixers and pumps to displace drilling fluids and place cement in the wellbore.",cementing

Contours are commonly drawn on maps to portray the structural configuration of the Earth's surface or formations in the subsurface. For example, structure maps contain contours of constant elevation with respect to a datum (such as sea level). Contours are also used to interpret subsurface configurations of rock bodies in areas of limited control, such as drawing contours of the thickness of a common rock unit in several widely separated wells to extrapolate its thickness in a nearby undrilled location.",contour

Drilling Fluids,"A measurement of the thickness of the filter cake, usually recorded in 32nds-inch. Under dynamic conditions, filter-cake thickness depends on rate of deposition versus erosion caused by fluid circulation and mechanical abrasion by the rotating drillstring.

Drilling,The colloquial term for the crew member in charge of a specialized cementing crew and trucks.,cementing engineer
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Abbreviation for a combination of forward combustion and waterflooding, also called wet combustion or in situ steam generation. COFCAW is an in situ combustion technique in which water is injected simultaneously or alternately with air into a formation. Wet combustion actually refers to wet forward combustion and was developed to use the great amount of heat that would otherwise be lost in the formation. The injected water recovers the heat from behind the burning front and transfers it to the oil bank ahead. Because of this additional energy, the oil displacement is more efficient and requires less air. In spite of these advantages, a wet combustion process cannot avoid liquid-blocking problems and use of wet combustion is limited by the oil viscosity.",COFCAW
Geology,"The value of the separation between two adjacent contours.

Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom plug is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom plug through an increase in pump pressure.",cementing plug
Heavy Oil,"The process of generating two or more forms of energy from a single energy source. For example, in a heavy oil field, turbines are often used to generate electricity while their waste heat is removed to generate steam.

Contract depth may be the final or total depth (TD) of the well, an intermediate point in the well or another milestone, such as running well-logging tools to the bottom of the hole. In the case of an intermediate contract depth, the work to deepen the well would likely be done on a day rate basis, or a time and materials contract.",contract depth
Drilling Fluids,"A compound with formula CaCO3 that occurs naturally as limestone. Ground and sized calcium carbonate is used to increase mud density to about 12 lbm/gal [1.44 kg/m3], and is preferable to barite because it is acid-soluble and can be dissolved with hydrochloric acid to clean up production zones. Its primary use today is as a bridging material in drill-in, completion and workover fluids. Sized calcium carbonate particles, along with polymers, control fluid loss in brines or drill-in, completion and workover fluids. Insoluble calcium carbonate is the precipitated byproduct of mud treatments used for removal of either Ca+2 or CO3-2 by addition of the other ion.",calcium carbonate
Well Completions,"A device fitted with a hinged collar and bowsprings to keep the casing or liner in the center of the wellbore to help ensure efficient placement of a cement sheath around the casing string.

Any leak or failure results in loss of control line pressure, acting to close the safety valve and render the well safe.",control line
Well Completions,"A temporary plug formulated with graded granules or flakes of calcium carbonate that are generally circulated into place as a slurry and allowed to settle out. Calcium carbonate plugs commonly are used to isolate lower production zones, either to enable a column of well control fluid to be placed, or to provide some protection for a lower zone while treating upper zones. Because of their high reaction rate with hydrochloric acid, calcium carbonate plugs are easily removed using common acidizing materials and equipment.",calcium carbonate plug

Production Logging,"A method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type of radioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells. In very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.",controlled time survey

Well Workover and Intervention,"A generic term relating to the use of a coiled tubing string and associated equipment. As a well-intervention method, coiled tubing techniques offer several key benefits over alternative well-intervention technologies. The ability to work safely under live well conditions, with a continuous string, enables fluids to be pumped at any time regardless of the position or direction of travel. This is a significant advantage in many applications. Installing an electrical conductor or hydraulic conduit further enhances the capability of a coiled tubing string and enables relatively complex intervention techniques to be applied safely.",coiled tubing
Shale Gas," Geology,A reservoir in which buoyant forces keep hydrocarbons in place below a sealing caprock. Reservoir and fluid characteristics of conventional reservoirs typically permit oil or natural gas to flow readily into wellbores.

Drilling Fluids,"The chemical CaSO4, which occurs naturally as the mineral anhydrite. Gypsum is the dihydrate mineral form, CaSO4·2H2O. Anhydrite and gypsum (commonly called gyp) are found in the subsurface and drilling even small stringers of these minerals can upset a freshwater or seawater mud. Gyp muds, lime muds and oil muds tolerate these salts best. CaSO4 is used as a mud treatment when no pH increase is needed to remove carbonate ion contamination in freshwater and seawater muds. (Lime increases pH when added for this purpose.) Gypsum and lime treatments are often used together to keep pH in the proper range. The test for determining the dissolved and undissolved calcium sulfate in a gyp mud requires two titrations with the strong EDTA reagent and Calver II® indicator when performed to API standards. It also requires a retort analysis for water content in the mud in order to calculate CaSO4 content, lbm/bbl.",calcium sulfate

Calibration coefficients, typically a gain and an offset, are calculated so that the tool or instrument reads correctly in the calibrator. The coefficients are then applied during subsequent measurements. The term master calibration is used for the regular, as for example quarterly, calibration of a logging tool in the workshop. For most wireline tools, a secondary calibrator is adjusted during the master calibration and taken to the wellsite so that a wellsite calibration can be done just prior to the logging job. Some tools, such as the gamma ray, are calibrated only at the wellsite. For most measurements-while-drilling tools, the environment requires that the calibration be performed at the workshop and only a verification made at the wellsite. For some measurements, there is a primary worldwide standard against which calibrators are calibrated, as for example, the radioactive formations at the University of Houston used to define gamma ray API units.",calibration
Formation Evaluation,"The condition in which cement flows in a channel only on some sides of the casing or borehole annulus, and thus does not provide adequate hydraulic isolation in all radial azimuths. The channel frequently manifests itself as an intermediate amplitude signal on a cement bond log. Pulse-echo tools are able to detect a channel because they measure the cement bond at different azimuths.",channeling
Well Workover and Intervention,"A continuous length of low-alloy carbon-steel tubing that can be spooled on a reel for transport, then deployed into a wellbore for the placement of fluids or manipulation of tools during workover and well-intervention operations. The process of spooling and straightening a coiled tubing string imparts a high degree of fatigue to the tube material. Therefore, a coiled tubing string should be regarded as a consumable product with a finite service life. Predicting and managing the factors that affect the safe working life of a coiled tubing string are key components of the string-management system necessary for ensuring safe and efficient coiled tubing operations.",coiled tubing string

Well Workover and Intervention,"The package of equipment required to run a coiled tubing operation. Four basic components are required: the coiled tubing reel to store and transport the coiled tubing string, the injector head to provide the tractive effort to run and retrieve the coiled tubing string, the control cabin from which the equipment operator controls and monitors the operation, and the power pack that generates the necessary hydraulic and pneumatic power required by the other components. The dimensions and capacities of the coiled tubing unit components determine the size and length of coiled tubing string that can be used on the unit. Pressure-control equipment is incorporated into the equipment to provide the necessary control of well pressure fluid during normal operating conditions and contingency situations requiring emergency control.",coiled tubing unit
Geophysics,"A mathematical operation on two functions that is the most general representation of the process of linear (invariant) filtering. Convolution can be applied to any two functions of time or space (or other variables) to yield a third function, the output of the convolution. Although the mathematical definition is symmetric with respect to the two input functions, it is common in signal processing to say that one of the functions is a filter acting on the other function. The response of many physical systems can be represented mathematically by a convolution. For example, a convolution can be used to model the filtering of seismic energy by the various rock layers in the Earth; deconvolution is used extensively in seismic processing to counteract that filtering. The mathematical form of the convolution of two functions, a filter f(t) and a time-series x(t), is y(t) = ∫ f(t−τ)x(τ)dτ, where y(t) is the output of the convolution. In the frequency domain, convolution is simply the product of the Fourier transforms (FT) of the two functions: Y(ω) = F(ω)*X(ω), where X(ω) = FT of the time series x(t) F(ω) = FT of the filter f(t) Y(ω) = FT of the output y(t) ω = angular frequency.",convolution
Well Testing,"A mathematical operation that uses downhole flow-rate measurements to transform bottomhole pressure measurements distorted by variable rates to an interpretable transient.

This operation is similar to what is done to account for the flow history in rigorous pressure-transient analysis.",convolution
Drilling,"A representation of the measured diameter of a borehole along its depth. Caliper logs are usually measured mechanically, with only a few using sonic devices. The tools measure diameter at a specific chord across the well. Since wellbores are usually irregular (rugose), it is important to have a tool that measures diameter at several different locations simultaneously. Such a tool is called a multifinger caliper. Drilling engineers or rigsite personnel use caliper measurement as a qualitative indication of both the condition of the wellbore and the degree to which the mud system has maintained hole stability. Caliper data are integrated to determine the volume of the openhole, which is then used in planning cementing operations.",caliper log

Geophysics,"A type of borehole seismic data designed to measure the seismic traveltime from the surface to a known depth. P-wave velocity of the formations encountered in a wellbore can be measured directly by lowering a geophone to each formation of interest, sending out a source of energy from the surface of the Earth, and recording the resultant signal. The data can then be correlated to surface seismic data by correcting the sonic log and generating a synthetic seismogram to confirm or modify seismic interpretations. It differs from a vertical seismic profile in the number and density of receiver depths recorded; geophone positions may be widely and irregularly located in the wellbore, whereas a vertical seismic profile usually has numerous geophones positioned at closely and regularly spaced intervals in the wellbore.",check shot survey
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Heavy Oil,A non-thermal primary process for producing heavy oil, also called CHOPS. In this method, continuous production of sand improves the recovery of heavy oil from the reservoir. There is both a theoretical basis and physical evidence that, in many cases, wormholes are formed in the unconsolidated sand reservoir, thereby increasing oil productivity. In most cases, an artificial lift system is used to lift the oil with sand.",cold heavy oil production with sand
Drilling Fluids,"A compound, CuCO3, that was used as a sulfide scavenger for water-base muds.

Drilling,"To deepen the wellbore by way of collecting a cylindrical sample of rock. A core bit is used to accomplish this, in conjunction with a core barrel and core catcher. The bit is usually a drag bit fitted with either PDC or natural diamond cutting structures, but the core bit is unusual in that it has a hole in its center. This allows the bit to drill around a central cylinder of rock, which is taken in through the bit and into the core barrel. The core barrel itself may be thought of as a special storage chamber for holding the rock core. The core catcher serves to grip the bottom of the core and, as tension is applied to the drillstring, the rock under the core breaks away from the undrilled formation below it. The core catcher also retains the core so that it does not fall out the bottom of the drillstring, which is open in the middle at that point.",core
Geology,"Innermost layer of the Earth. Studies of compressional and shear waves indicate that the core makes up nearly 3500 km [2170 miles] of the Earth's radius of 6370 km [3950 miles]. Such studies also demonstrate that because shear waves do not pass through the outer part of the core (2250 km [1400 miles] thick), it is liquid (only solids can shear). The inner core is solid and 1220 km [750 miles] thick. The core's iron and nickel composition was inferred through studies of the Earth's gravitational field and average density. The relatively low density of the outer layers of the Earth suggests a dense inner layer.",core
Formation Evaluation,"A cylindrical sample of geologic formation, usually reservoir rock, taken during or after drilling a well. Cores can be full-diameter cores (that is, they are nearly as large in diameter as the drill bit) taken at the time of drilling the zone, or sidewall cores (generally less than 1 in. [2.5 cm] in diameter) taken after a hole has been drilled. Cores samples are used for many studies, some of which relate to drilling fluids and damage done by them.",core

Well Workover and Intervention,"The pressure at which a tube, or vessel, will catastrophically deform as a result of differential pressure acting from outside to inside of the vessel or tube. The collapse-pressure rating of perfectly round tubing is relatively high. However, when the tubing is even slightly oval, the differential pressure at which the tube will collapse may be significantly reduced. This is an important factor in determining the operating limits of coiled tubing strings since the action of spooling the string tends to induce some ovality.",collapse pressure
Formation Evaluation," Shale Gas,Laboratory study of a sample of a geologic formation, usually reservoir rock, taken during or after drilling a well. Economic and efficient oil and gas production is highly dependent on understanding key properties of reservoir rock, such as porosity, permeability, and wettability. Geoscientists have developed a variety of approaches, including log and core analysis techniques, to measure these properties. Core analysis is especially important in shale reservoirs because of the vertical and lateral heterogeneity of the rocks. Core analysis can include evaluation of rock properties and anisotropy; organic matter content, maturity, and type; fluid content; fluid sensitivity; and geomechanical properties. This information can be used to calibrate log and seismic measurements and to help in well and completion design, well placement, and other aspects of reservoir production.",core analysis
Production Logging,"An in situ record of the capability of the fluid passing through a sensor to store electrical charge. Since water has a high dielectric constant, and hence capacitance, it can be distinguished from oil or gas. The capacitance, or fluid capacitance log, can therefore identify water and be scaled in terms of water holdup. However, the relation between capacitance and holdup depends strongly on whether the water is the continuous phase, complicating quantitative evaluation. The log was introduced in the 1960s with the so-called holdup meter. It was mainly used in three-phase flow, or when fluid-density measurements were insufficiently sensitive to water at low holdup, or with heavy oils. Since the late 1980s, other holdup measurements have been preferred.",capacitance log

Production Logging,"Another term for holdup meter, a device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid. The holdup meter is used to produce a capacitance log. Since water has a high dielectric constant, and hence capacitance, it can be distinguished from oil or gas. The meter is a coaxial capacitor, with fluid flowing between a central probe and an external cage that act as electrodes. The meter has often been combined with a packer flowmeter or a diverter flowmeter, so that all the fluids in the well pass through the meter.",capacitance meter
Well Completions," Well Workover and Intervention, Drilling Fluids,A chemical used to bind metal ions to form a ring structure. Chelating agents stabilize or prevent the precipitation of damaging compounds. In the oil field, chelating agents are used in stimulation treatments and for cleaning surface facilities. They are also used to treat or remove scale or weighting agents in reservoir drilling fluids. During acid or scale-removal treatments, various compounds may be dissolved in the treatment fluid. As the acid reacts and the pH increases, reaction products may precipitate as a gelatinous, insoluble mass. Should this occur within the formation matrix, it is almost impossible to remove and permanent permeability damage may occur. Chelating agents prevent precipitation by keeping ions in a soluble form until the treatment fluid can be flowed back from the formation during cleanup. Typical oilfield chelating agents include EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), HEDTA (hydroxyethylenediamine triacetic acid), NTA (nitriolotriacetic acid) and citric acid.",chelating agent
Well Workover and Intervention," Well Completions,A chemical added to an acid to stabilize iron. The injected acid dissolves iron from rust, millscale, iron scales or iron-containing minerals in the formation. Iron can exist as ferric iron [Fe+3] or ferrous iron [Fe+2]. If the iron is not controlled, it will precipitate insoluble products such as ferric hydroxide and, in sour environments, ferrous sulfide [FeS], which will damage the formation. Chelating agents associate with iron [Fe+3 or Fe+2] to form soluble complexes. Citric acid, acetic acid and EDTA are effective chelating agents and can be used at temperatures up to 400oF [204oC].",chelating agent

Formation Evaluation,"An image of the external or internal features of a core. External images are photographs taken under natural or ultraviolet light; natural light highlights lithology and sedimentary structures, while ultraviolet light causes hydrocarbon zones to fluoresce. Internal images are obtained using X-rays or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). X-ray techniques measure the attenuation of X-rays passing through the core. The attenuation depends mainly on the density. Hence the image reflects density and lithology changes, internal bedding planes, fractures and nodules. These techniques include, in increasing resolution, fluoroscopy, X-radiography and computed tomography. Most NMR images measure the quantity and relaxation time of hydrogen, and therefore give information on fluid distribution. Some NMR techniques examine carbon, sodium and phosphorous.",core image
Well Workover and Intervention,"An equilibrium reaction between a metal ion and a complexing agent.

Core plugs are ordinarily cut perpendicular to the axis of the core or parallel to the axis, called horizontal and vertical plugs, respectively, when cut from a vertical wellbore. The terms horizontal and vertical are often applied for cores cut from a deviated or horizontal wellbore, even though they are not strictly correct unless core orientation is measured and plugs are cut to the true in-situ orientation.",core plug
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A dimensionless group used in analysis of fluid flow that characterizes the ratio of viscous forces to surface or interfacial tension forces. It is usually denoted NC in the oil field and Ca in chemical engineering. For a flowing liquid, if NC >>1, then viscous forces dominate over interfacial forces; however if NC <<1, then viscous forces are negligible compared with interfacial forces. Capillary numbers are usually large for high-speed flows and low for low-speed flows; thus, typically for flow through pores in the reservoir NC is ~10−6, and for flow in production tubulars NC is ~1. Capillary number equation: NC = Ca = (μU) / σ where NC = Ca = capillary number μ = fluid viscosity U = fluid velocity σ = surface or interfacial tension.",capillary number
Drilling Fluids,"A 20- to 50-gallon [3.2- to 7.9 m3] container for liquid mud additives, usually located above the suction pit on a drilling rig. The chemical barrel is used to slowly dispense various types of liquids into the active mud system. It has traditionally been used to add caustic (NaOH or KOH) solution at a slow and steady rate in order to maintain a uniform pH throughout a circulating mud system. Adding caustic solution is an especially risky operation and the proper design and use of the chemical barrel for safety is vitally important. Derrickmen must be informed of the dangers, proper protective clothing and safety rules to follow when using the chemical barrel.",chemical barrel

The capillary pressure curve is important for understanding saturation distribution in the reservoir and affects imbibition and multiphase fluid flow through the rock.",capillary pressure curve
Perforating,"A downhole tool run on wireline to sever tubing at a predetermined point when the tubing string becomes stuck. When activated, the chemical cutter use a small explosive charge to forcefully direct high-pressure jets of highly corrosive material in a circumferential pattern against the tubular wall. The nearly instantaneous massive corrosion of the surrounding tubing wall creates a relatively even cut with minimal distortion of the tubing, aiding subsequent fishing operations.",chemical cutter
Well Workover and Intervention,"The electrical device used on the axle of a spool or reel to provide electrical continuity between the rotating reel core and the stationary reel chassis.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A laboratory test in which a fluid or combination of fluids is injected into a sample of rock. Objectives include measurement of permeability, relative permeability, saturation change, formation damage caused by the fluid injection, or interactions between the fluid and the rock. The core material often comes from an oil reservoir, but some tests use outcrop rock. The fluid in place at the start of the test is typically either a simulated formation brine, oil (either crude oil or refined oil), or a combination of brine and oil. Injected fluids may include crude oil, simulated reservoir brine, refined fluids, drilling mud filtrate, acids, foam or other chemicals used in the oil field. Depending on the purpose of the test, conditions may be either ambient temperature and low confining pressure or high temperature and pressure of a subject reservoir. Pressures and flow rates at both ends of the core are measured, and the core can also be investigated using other measurements such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) during the test. A coreflood is typically used to determine the optimum development option for an oil reservoir and often helps evaluate the effect of injecting fluids specially designed to improve or enhance oil recovery.",coreflooding
Drilling Fluids,"A type of static filtration test for water-base drilling fluid that measures the filtration rate (time for free water to pass between two electrodes) using filter paper as the medium.

The collision of two plates of continental lithosphere, known as an A-type collision, can produce high mountains as rocks are folded, faulted and uplifted to accommodate the converging plates, as observed in the Alps and the Himalayas. B-type collisions, in which oceanic lithospheric plates collide with continental lithospheric plates, typically produce a subduction zone where the relatively denser oceanic plate descends below the relatively lighter continental plate, as seen on the Pacific coast of South America.",collision
Drilling Fluids,"A specially designed fluid that is used for cutting cores with a core barrel and core bit.

A corkscrew hole affects measurements sensitive to standoff, such as induction and neutron porosity, and may affect pad tools, if they cannot follow the changes.",corkscrew hole
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A general term for injection processes that use special chemical solutions. Micellar, alkaline and soap-like substances are used to reduce surface tension between oil and water in the reservoir, whereas polymers such as polyacrylamide or polysaccharide are employed to improve sweep efficiency. The chemical solutions are pumped through specially distributed injection wells to mobilize oil left behind after primary or secondary recovery. Chemical flooding is a major component of enhanced oil recovery processes and can be subdivided into micellar-polymer flooding and alkaline flooding. The general procedure of a chemical flooding includes a preflush (low-salinity water), a chemical solution (micellar or alkaline), a mobility buffer and, finally, a driving fluid (water), which displaces the chemicals and the resulting oil bank to production wells.

Well Testing,"A procedure for correcting pressure measurements in a reservoir to a common datum level. This is not required for calculating kh, permeability thickness, and s, skin effect, but is required for determining average reservoir pressures or for any comparison of pressures in one area of the reservoir to those in another area. The correction is done by determining the average pressure for a given well test in which the pressure gauge is at a known level, and then adding or subtracting the calculated weight of the column of reservoir fluid in pounds per square inch from the difference in elevation between the pressure gauge and the datum level.",correcting pressure to a datum

Drilling,"A test performed by the mudlogger or wellsite geologist, used to calculate sample lag. The lag period can be measured as a function of time or pump strokes. Acetylene is commonly used as a tracer gas for this purpose. This gas is generated by calcium carbide, a man-made product that reacts with water. Usually, a small paper packet containing calcium carbide is inserted into the drillstring when the kelly is unscrewed from the pipe to make a connection, and the time is noted, along with the pump-stroke count on the mud pump. Once the connection is made and drilling resumes, the packet is pumped downhole with the drilling fluid. Along the way, the drilling fluid breaks down the paper and reacts with the calcium carbide. The resulting acetylene gas circulates with the drilling fluid until it reaches the surface, where it is detected at the gas trap, causing a rapid increase or spike in gas readings. The time and pump-stroke count are again noted, and the cuttings sample lag interval is calculated.",carbide lag test

Note that since the pipe is put into the well bottom first, the smaller pipe is run into the hole first, followed by the larger diameter. Other than the different sizes, which are usually chosen to optimize well economics, there is nothing distinctive about the pipe sections. However, pipe-handling tools must be available for each pipe size, not just one size, as is the typical case.",combination string

Corrosion can occur anywhere in the production system, either at bottomhole or in surface lines and equipment. Some practices for corrosion control involve: cathodic protection, chemical inhibition, chemical control (removal of dissolved gases such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide and oxygen), oxygen scavenging, pH adjustment, deposition control (for example, scales) and coatings. One of the most difficult environments for corrosion control is high bottomhole temperatures, such as 400 to 500oF [200 to 260oC]. The corrosion rate will vary with time depending on the particular conditions of the oil field, such as the amount of water produced, secondary recovery operations and pressure variations.

Drilling Fluids,"An anion with formula CO3-2. Carbonate chemistry involves a pH-dependent equilibrium between H2O, H+, OH-, CO2, HCO3- and CO3-2. At low pH, carbon dioxide [CO2] dominates. As pH rises from acidic toward neutral, HCO3- ions dominate. As pH rises above neutral, CO3-2 ions dominate. If no component is lost from the system (such as CO2 gas evolving), changing pH up and down continually reverses the relative proportion of the carbonate species. Carbonates play several important roles in water mud chemistry. One role is the corrosion of metals by acidic CO2. A second is the formation of calcium carbonate [CaCO3] scale on surfaces by carbonate and calcium ion reactions. Another role is in the chemistry of deflocculated mud, where bicarbonate ions prevent attachment of deflocculants such as lignosulfonate, onto clay edge charges.",carbonate ion

Drilling Fluids,"A drilling-fluid additive used primarily for fluid-loss control, manufactured by reacting natural cellulose with monochloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide [NaOH] to form CMC sodium salt. Up to 20 wt % of CMC may be NaCl, a by-product of manufacture, but purified grades of CMC contain only small amounts of NaCl. To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO-) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water solubility and negativity of the polymer, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a mud additive. Drilling grade CMCs used in muds typically have degree-of-substitution around 0.80 to 0.96.

In the oil industry, cosurfactants are often used to increase the oil-solubilizing capacity of microemulsion surfactant systems. An example of such a cosurfactant is a long-chain alcohol. Pure surfactants often organize well at a liquid/liquid boundary, which leads to relatively stiff interfaces or even liquid-crystal phases. To achieve ultralow interfacial tension for enhanced oil recovery applications, a cosurfactant is added to disturb this organization at the liquid/liquid interface. Cosurfactants can also be used to fine-tune the formulation phase behavior, for example, by expanding the temperature or salinity range of microemulsion formation.",cosurfactant

Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, referring to the cycle of radio frequency pulses designed by Carr, Purcell, Meiboom and Gill to produce pulse echoes and counteract dephasing due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. In the CPMG sequence, an initial radio frequency pulse is applied long enough to tip the protons into a plane perpendicular to the static magnetic field (the 90o pulse). Initially the protons precess in unison, producing a large signal in the antenna, but then quickly dephase due to the inhomogeneities. Another pulse is applied, long enough to reverse their direction of precession (the 180o pulse), and causing them to come back in phase again after a short time. Being in phase, they produce another strong signal called an echo. They quickly dephase again but can be rephased by another 180o pulse. Rephasing is repeated many times, while measuring the magnitude of each echo. This magnitude decreases with time due to molecular relaxation mechanisms surface, bulk and diffusion. One measurement typically may comprise many hundreds of echoes, while the time between each echo (the echo spacing) is of the order of 1 ms or less.

A continuous 360-degree annular space around casing allows cement to completely seal the casing to the borehole wall. There are two distinct classes of centralizers.

Since the bow springs are slightly larger than the wellbore, they can provide complete centralization in vertical or slightly deviated wells. However, they do not support the weight of the casing very well in deviated wellbores. The second type is a rigid blade design. This type is rugged and works well even in deviated wellbores, but since the centralizers are smaller than the wellbore, they will not provide as good centralization as bow-spring type centralizers in vertical wells.

Contour intervals are chosen according to the map scale and the amount and distribution of control points.",CI
Drilling,"The representative of the oil company or operator on a drilling location. For land operations, the company man is responsible for operational issues on the location, including the safety and efficiency of the project. Even administrative managers are expected to respond to the direction of the company man when they are on the rigsite. Offshore, depending on the regulatory requirements, there may be an offshore installation manager, who supervises the company man on safety and vessel integrity issues, but not on operational issues.",company representative
Geophysics,"The minimum damping that will prevent or stop oscillation in the shortest amount of time, typically associated with oscillatory systems like geophones. Critical damping is symbolized by μc.",critical damping
Geophysics,"A technique for acquiring full-azimuth marine seismic data. This technique uses a vessel equipped with source arrays and streamers to shoot and record seismic data; however, unlike conventional surveys acquired in a series of parallel straight lines, circle shooting surveys are acquired as the vessel steams in a series of overlapping, continuously linked circles, or coils. The circular shooting geometry acquires a full range of offset data across every azimuth to sample the subsurface geology in all directions. The resulting full azimuth (FAZ) data are used to image complex geology, such as highly faulted strata, basalt, carbonate reefs and subsalt formations.",circle shooting
Reservoir Characterization,"The productive segment of an oil or gas field that is not in fluid communication with the remainder of the field.

Production Testing,"In sand control operations, the maximum production rate below which the production of solids along with the produced fluid is uniform. When the flow rate exceeds this threshold, the production of sand and fines increases significantly.

The degree of compartmentalization may vary as a consequence of production.,compartmentalization
Production Testing,The gas flow rate equivalent to the speed of sound in that fluid. Exceeding this limit during gas production accelerates corrosion in the pipelines.,critical gas flow rate
Well Completions,"A completion configuration in which a production casing string is set across the reservoir interval and perforated to allow communication between the formation and wellbore. The casing performs several functions, including supporting the surrounding formation under production conditions, enabling control of fluid production through selective perforation and allowing subsequent or remedial isolation by packers, plugs or special treatments.",casing completion
Drilling,"To pump the drilling fluid until a sample from the bottom of the hole reaches the surface. This is commonly performed when drilling has ceased so that the wellsite geologist may collect a cuttings sample from the formation being drilled, or when the driller suspects that a small amount of gas has entered the wellbore. Thus, by circulating out, the gas bubble is eased out of the wellbore safely.",circulate out
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"In matrix stimulation, a characteristic of rock that indicates formation permeability is not reduced when treating fluids and their additives contact the formation minerals or fluids inside the reservoir. Compatibility is especially important in sandstone treatments, in which potentially damaging reactions may occur.

Formation Evaluation,"Scales for different logs that are chosen so that the logs will overlay in certain conditions. For example, a sandstone-compatible scale may have the neutron log scaled from 0.45 to -0.15 vol/vol and the density from 1.9 to 2.9 g/cm3. Then, in a pure quartz sandstone filled with fresh water, the two logs will overlay as the porosity varies.",compatible scales

The critical moment is the time of highest probability of entrapment and preservation of hydrocarbons in a petroleum system-after traps form and hydrocarbons migrate into a reservoir and accumulate-and marks the beginning of preservation in a viable petroleum system.,critical moment
Drilling,"A system of identifying and categorizing the strength of casing materials. Since most oilfield casing is of approximately the same chemistry (typically steel), and differs only in the heat treatment applied, the grading system provides for standardized strengths of casing to be manufactured and used in wellbores. The first part of the nomenclature, a letter, refers to the tensile strength. The second part of the designation, a number, refers to the minimum yield strength of the metal (after heat treatment) at 1000 psi [6895 KPa]. For example, the casing grade J-55 has minimum yield strength of 55,000 psi [379,211 KPa]. The casing grade P-110 designates a higher strength pipe with minimum yield strength of 110,000 psi [758,422 KPa]. The appropriate casing grade for any application typically is based on pressure and corrosion requirements. Since the well designer is concerned about the pipe yielding under various loading conditions, the casing grade is the number that is used in most calculations. High-strength casing materials are more expensive, so a casing string may incorporate two or more casing grades to optimize costs while maintaining adequate mechanical performance over the length of the string. It is also important to note that, in general, the higher the yield strength, the more susceptible the casing is to sulfide stress cracking (H2S-induced cracking). Therefore, if H2S is anticipated, the well designer may not be able to use tubulars with strength as high as he or she would like.",casing grade
Well Completions,"A completion component, generally included in the lower assembly near the packer, that allows communication between the tubing and annulus. Circulation devices enable the circulation of fluids for well control or kickoff purposes.",circulation device
Formation Evaluation,"A density log that has been corrected for the effect of mud and mudcake by using two or more detectors at different spacings from the source. The shorter the spacing, the shallower the depth of investigation and the larger the effect of the mudcake. Thus, a short spaced detector, which is very sensitive to the mudcake, can be used to correct a long-spaced detector, which is only slightly sensitive to it. In a typical two-detector compensation scheme, the density measured by the longest spacing detector is corrected by an amount, delta rho, which is a function of the difference between long- and short-spacing densities. The correction is found to depend on the difference between formation and mudcake density multiplied by mudcake thickness. Although there are three unknowns, simple functions are reliable for moderate corrections. Experimental results are often presented in the form of a spine and ribs plot. There are other schemes using, for example, more detectors. Dual detector density logs were introduced in the mid 1960s.",compensated density log

Drilling,"The loss of drilling fluid to a formation, usually caused when the hydrostatic head pressure of the column of drilling fluid exceeds the formation pressure. This loss of fluid may be loosely classified as seepage losses, partial losses or catastrophic losses, each of which is handled differently depending on the risk to the rig and personnel and the economics of the drilling fluid and each possible solution.",circulation loss
Formation Evaluation,"A neutron porosity log in which the effects of the borehole environment are minimized by using two detectors. In the most common technique, the two source-detector spacings are chosen so that the ratio of the two count rates is relatively independent of the borehole environment. This ratio is then calibrated in terms of porosity in a known formation and borehole environment typically with the tool placed against the side of an 8-in. [20-cm] borehole in a limestone block, both filled with fresh water at surface temperature and pressure. The response is also determined at different porosities and in sandstones, dolomites and other borehole environments. Correction factors are developed to convert the measured log to the standard conditions. The source and detectors are not azimuthally focused. Wireline tools are run eccentralized against the borehole wall. Since the neutrons emitted into the mud are strongly attenuated, the resulting log is effectively focused into the formation. Measurements-while-drilling tools will normally be unfocused since they are centralized unless the borehole is overgauge. The vertical resolution is about 2 ft [0.6 m], but can be improved by alpha processing.",compensated neutron log

Geology,"Describes a bed that maintains its original thickness during deformation. Often pertains to relatively brittle, solid strata that deform by faulting, fracturing or folding, rather than flowing under stress.

Well Completions,"A generic term used to describe the assembly of downhole tubulars and equipment required to enable safe and efficient production from an oil or gas well.

Well Completions,"A solids-free liquid used to complete an oil or gas well. This fluid is placed in the well to facilitate final operations prior to initiation of production, such as setting screens production liners, packers, downhole valves or shooting perforations into the producing zone. The fluid is meant to control a well should downhole hardware fail, without damaging the producing formation or completion components. Completion fluids are typically brines (chlorides, bromides and formates), but in theory could be any fluid of proper density and flow characteristics. The fluid should be chemically compatible with the reservoir formation and fluids, and is typically filtered to a high degree to avoid introducing solids to the near-wellbore area. Seldom is a regular drilling fluid suitable for completion operations due to its solids content, pH and ionic composition. Drill-in fluids can, in some cases, be suitable for both purposes.",completion fluid

Cross sections for most reactions are determined experimentally and depend on the type of interaction, the material and the energy of the incident particle.",cross section
Well Workover and Intervention,"A downhole assembly or tool system used in the remedial repair of casing damage, corrosion or leaks. Casing patches are most frequently used as short- to medium-term repairs that enable production to be resumed until a major workover operation is scheduled.

Drilling,"The location, or depth, at which drilling an interval of a particular diameter hole ceases, so that casing of a given size can be run and cemented. Establishing correct casing points is important in the design of the drilling fluid program. The casing point may be a predetermined depth, or it may be selected onsite by a pressure hunt team, selected onsite according to geological observations or dictated by problems in the openhole section. In many cases, weak or underpressure zones must be protected by casing to enable mud weight adjustments that control unstable formations or overpressure zones deeper in the wellbore.",casing point
Reservoir Characterization,"A conventional method of mapping reservoir parameters in two dimensions, x and y. The resulting map set usually includes the top and bottom structure map derived from seismic and well data and that are used to generate thickness maps, in addition to maps of other geological and petrophysical parameters produced by standard interpolation techniques. These techniques are appropriate for describing reservoirs that are reasonably continuous and not too heterogeneous. They are usually much faster than full 3D techniques or geostatistical methods, but may be inaccurate when applied to description of complex, heterogeneous strata.",classical reservoir modeling
Well Completions,"An indicator used to determine the effect that key completion components have on the production efficiency of a well.

Production Logging,"An in situ log of the electrical potential on the inner wall of a casing. The log is used to identify intervals that are susceptible to corrosion. A negative slope in the profile indicates a zone in which current is leaving the casing and therefore acting as an anode. Such zones are susceptible to corrosion. The log was first introduced in the early 1960s. Modern logs are recorded with the tool stationary, and measure the potential difference and casing resistance between several pairs of sensors pushed against the casing wall, and between sensors and surface. The log is usually represented with casing resistance and casing axial current. Sharp increases in casing resistance can indicate corroded zones or even holes in the casing. Decreasing axial current with depth indicates a corroding region.",casing potential profile
Geology,"Structures formed by sediment injection. Because they resemble intrusive and extrusive igneous features, much of the vocabulary for describing clastic intrusions, or injectites, comes from igneous geology. Sills are emplaced parallel to bedding, whereas dikes cut through bedding. The strata containing the intrusion are called host strata and the layers that feed the intrusion are the parent beds. Sand-injection features exhibit size scales from millimeters to kilometers, and have been seen in cores, borehole image logs, seismic sections, outcrops, aerial photographs and satellite images.",clastic intrusion
Geophysics,"A mathematical method to determine seismic attributes, including reflection strength and instantaneous frequency, by using the Hilbert transform, a special form of the Fourier transform, and the quadrature trace, or the component of the signal that is 90 degrees out of phase. The Fourier transform a(t) = h(t) + jx(t), where h(t) = seismic trace x(t) = quadrature trace can be used to determine reflection strength by combining h and x: r(t) = [h(t)2 + x(t)2]1/2, and to determine instantaneous phase: θ(t) = tan−1[x(t)/h(t)].",complex trace analysis
Production Logging,"A device for measuring fluid velocity in a production well. The device measures the transit time of a disturbance between two sensors separated by a fixed distance. The technology applies to multiphase flow, in which the disturbance is caused, for example, by the passage of a bubble of gas over each sensor. In practice, there will be many bubbles of gas, so it is necessary to record both sensor signals over a time window and compare, or correlate, them. The two signals will correlate best after shifting one of them by a time corresponding to the average transit time of the bubbles. Different sensors may be used, for example a measure of electrical capacitance as in a holdup meter. The crosscorrelation flowmeter gives the velocity of the disturbance. Since this is caused by just one of the phases, it produces a type of phase velocity log.",crosscorrelation flowmeter

Geology,"An unusual occurrence of hydrocarbon in which molecules of natural gas, typically methane, are trapped in ice molecules. More generally, hydrates are compounds in which gas molecules are trapped within a crystal structure. Hydrates form in cold climates, such as permafrost zones and in deep water. To date, economic liberation of hydrocarbon gases from hydrates has not occurred, but hydrates contain quantities of hydrocarbons that could be of great economic significance. Hydrates can affect seismic data by creating a reflection or multiple.",clathrate
Production Testing,"Compounds or complex ions that are formed by the union of water with other substances. Hydrates can form in pipelines and in gas gathering, compression and transmission facilities at reduced temperatures and high pressures. Once hydrates are formed, they can plug the pipelines and significantly affect production operations.",clathrate
Drilling Fluids,"A crystalline solid consisting of water with gas molecules in an ice-like cage structure. The general term for this type of solid is clathrate. Water molecules form a lattice structure into which many types of gas molecules can fit. Most gases, except hydrogen and helium, can form hydrates. C1 to nC5 hydrocarbons, H2S and CO2 readily form hydrates at low temperature and high pressure. Heavier hydrocarbons may also enter the structure but do not form hydrates by themselves. Gas-cut muds can form hydrates in deepwater drilling operations, plugging BOP lines, risers and subsea wellheads, causing a well-control risk. Gas hydrates are thermodynamically suppressed by adding antifreeze materials such as salts or glycols. A common practice is to use 20 to 23 wt.% NaCl. Nucleation and growth of hydrates can be dynamically inhibited by certain polymers or surfactants. Gas hydrates are found in nature, on the bottom of cold seas and in arctic permafrost regions. Drilling into these can be hazardous, but they offer another source of hydrocarbons for future exploitation.

Geology,"A group of rock-forming, hydrous aluminum silicate minerals that are platy in structure and can form by the alteration of silicate minerals like feldspar and amphibole. Common examples include chlorite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and smectite. Some clays, such as montmorillonite, have the tendency to swell when exposed to water, creating a potential drilling hazard when clay-bearing rock formations are exposed to water-base fluids during drilling, possibly reducing the permeability of a good reservoir rock. Some clays are used in drilling fluids to form an impermeable mudcake to isolate a formation from the invasion of drilling fluid. The structural difference among clays (smectite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite) determines the surface area exposed to reservoir fluids or stimulating fluids. Generally, higher surface area indicates higher reactivity. However, not all the clay present in a rock is reactive. Clays can be found in pore spaces, as part of the matrix or as grain-cementing material. Authigenic clays, which grow in the pores from minerals in the connate water, can be pore-filling or pore-lining. These clays have considerable surface area exposed in the pore and can be reactive, while detrital clays that are part of the matrix are usually less reactive. Additionally, clays as cementing, or grain-binding, materials may react with water or acid to disaggregate the formation if they are not protected by quartz overgrowths. The most common clays that create clay problems are kaolinite, smectite, illite and chlorite. These minerals can be treated using hydrofluoric acid [HF].",clay
Drilling Fluids,"A large family of complex minerals containing the elements magnesium, aluminum, silicon and oxygen (magnesium, aluminum silicates) combined in a sheet-like structure. Clays are mined from surface pits as relatively pure deposits and used for bricks, pottery, foundry molds and in drilling fluids among other uses. Clays, as claystones, shales and intermixed with sands and sandstones make up the largest percentage of minerals drilled while exploring for oil and gas. Sodium bentonite is a useful additive for increasing the density of drilling muds, but other clay types are considered contaminants to be avoided and removed. Individual clay platelets can be viewed only with an electron microscope. Crystal structures are also determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The atomic structure of the clay group of layered silicate minerals varies from two-layer to three-layer or four-layer (mixed-layer) structures. One of the structural layers is a plane of silicon dioxide tetrahedra (silicon at the center and oxygen at all four corners of the tetrahedron). The other structural layer is a plane of aluminum hydroxide octahedra (aluminum at the center and hydroxides at all six corners). The tetrahedral and octahedral layers fit one on top of the other, with oxygen atoms being shared as oxide and hydroxide groups.",clay
Formation Evaluation,"A single log created by splicing together two logs of the same type run at different times in the well; or by splicing two different types of log run at the same time.

Formation Evaluation,"Water within the clay lattice or near the surface within the electrical double layer. This water does not move when fluid is flowed through the rock. In the normal definition used by a log analyst, clay-bound water is not part of the effective porosity and is the difference between total porosity and effective porosity. Clay-bound water is understood to include the interlayer water, although the contribution of the latter to the electrical properties of the clay may be different from the water in the electrical double layer. In the dual-water and the Hill-Shirley-Klein models, the volume of clay-bound water is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit volume, Qv, by expressions that depend on the salinity and temperature of the electrolyte in which the clay is immersed. Direct measurement of the clay-bound water volume in the laboratory is difficult.",clay bound water

Drilling Fluids,"A class of polymers added to a drilling-grade clay mineral during grinding, or added directly into a clay-based mud system, to enhance the clay's rheological performance. In concept, clay-extender polymers achieve the type of rheology needed for fast drilling with fewer colloidal solids and lower viscosity at high shear rate (at the bit). This is the concept of a low-solids, nondispersed mud system. Extenders are usually long-chain anionic or nonionic polymers that link clay platelets together in large networks. Anionic polymers are highly effective but can be precipitated by hardness ions. Nonionic polymers are less effective but also much less sensitive to hardness ions. Excessively long, linear polymers may break up under mechanical shearing. Either by precipitation or breakup, extender polymers can quickly become ineffective if poorly chosen and used improperly. A drilling-grade clay that has no extender is that which meets the standard for API nontreated bentonite. API bentonite and OCMA-grade API bentonite usually contain extender polymers.",clay extender

These analytical techniques include, but are not limited to, gas or liquid chromatography, cryogenic and flash distillations, true boiling-point distillations, structural fluid characterizations such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon analysis, SARA analysis, sonic testing and other crude oil assay methods.

Well Workover and Intervention,"A chemical additive used in stimulation treatments to prevent the migration or swelling of clay particles in reaction to water-base fluid. Without adequate protection, some water-base fluids can affect the electrical charge of naturally occurring clay platelets in the formation. Modifying the charge causes the platelets to swell or migrate in the flowing fluid and, once these are dispersed, it is likely that some clay plugging of the formation matrix will occur. Clay stabilizers act to retain the clay platelets in position by controlling the charge and electrolytic characteristics of the treatment fluid.",clay stabilizer
Formation Evaluation,The ratio of the percent change in volume to the change in pressure applied to a fluid or rock.,compressibility

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A type of damage in which formation permeability is reduced because of the alteration of clay equilibrium. Clay swelling occurs when water-base filtrates from drilling, completion, workover or stimulation fluids enter the formation. Clay swelling can be caused by ion exchange or changes in salinity. However, only clays that are directly contacted by the fluid moving in the rock will react; these include authigenic clays, some detrital clays on the pore boundaries and unprotected clay cement. The nature of the reaction depends on the structure of the clays and their chemical state at the moment of contact. The most common swelling clays are smectite and smectite mixtures that create an almost impermeable barrier for fluid flow when they are located in the larger pores of a reservoir rock. In some cases, brines such as potassium chloride [KCl] are used in completion or workover operations to avoid clay swelling.",clay swelling
Production Facilities,"The ratio of the volume of an engines cylinder at the beginning of the compression to its volume at the end of the compression process.

Formation Evaluation,"The porosity obtained by plotting two porosity logs against each other, normally density and neutron porosity. The computation assumes a particular fluid, usually fresh water, and particular response equations. The result is largely independent of lithology and is often a more reliable estimate of porosity than a single porosity log. It is often displayed as a quicklook log.",crossplot porosity
Drilling,"An assembled length of steel pipe configured to suit a specific wellbore. The sections of pipe are connected and lowered into a wellbore, then cemented in place. The pipe joints are typically approximately 40 ft [12 m] in length, male threaded on each end and connected with short lengths of double-female threaded pipe called couplings. Long casing strings may require higher strength materials on the upper portion of the string to withstand the string load. Lower portions of the string may be assembled with casing of a greater wall thickness to withstand the extreme pressures likely at depth. Casing is run to protect or isolate formations adjacent to the wellbore. The following are the most common reasons for running casing in a well: 1) protect fresh-water aquifers (surface casing) 2) provide strength for installation of wellhead equipment, including BOPs 3) provide pressure integrity so that wellhead equipment, including BOPs, may be closed 4) seal off leaky or fractured formations into which drilling fluids are lost 5) seal off low-strength formations so that higher strength (and generally higher pressure) formations may be penetrated safely 6) seal off high-pressure zones so that lower pressure formations may be drilled with lower drilling fluid densities 7) seal off troublesome formations, such as flowing salt 8) comply with regulatory requirements (usually related to one of the factors listed above).",casing string
Drilling Fluids,"An all-inclusive term to describe various progressive interactions between clay minerals and water. In the dry state, clay packets exist in face-to-face stacks like a deck of playing cards, but clay packets begin to change when exposed to water. Five descriptive terms describe the progressive interactions that can occur in a clay-water system, such as a water mud. 1) Hydration occurs as clay packets absorb water and swell. 2) Dispersion (or disaggregation) causes clay platelets to break apart and disperse into the water due to loss of attractive forces as water forces the platelets farther apart. 3) Flocculation begins when mechanical shearing stops and platelets previously dispersed come together due to the attractive force of surface charges on the platelets. 4) Deflocculation, the opposite effect, occurs by addition of chemical deflocculant to flocculated mud; the positive edge charges are covered and attraction forces are greatly reduced. 5) Aggregation, a result of ionic or thermal conditions, alters the hydrational layer around clay platelets, removes the deflocculant from positive edge charges and allows platelets to assume a face-to-face structure.",clay water interaction

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for measuring formation resistivity between two or more wells. This technique measures the signal between an electromagnetic induction transmitter in one well, and a receiver array located in another well. The transmitting antenna broadcasts a continuous sinusoidal signal at programmable frequencies. Tomographic processing creates a map of resistivity of the area between the wells. Measurements acquired by this technique have a greater depth of investigation than conventional logging tools and are sensitive to fluid content.

Several compressor stations can be used to repressurize gas in large interstate gas pipelines or to link offshore gas fields to their final terminals.",compressor plant
Formation Evaluation," Geophysics,A survey technique that measures the seismic signal transmitted from a source, located in one well, to a receiver array in a neighboring well. The resulting data are processed to create a reflection image or to map the acoustic velocity or other properties (velocities of P- and S-waves, for example) of the area between wells. Placement of the source and receiver array in adjacent wells not only enables the formation between wells to be surveyed, it also avoids seismic signal propagation through attenuative near-surface formations. Another advantage is that it places the source and receiver near the reservoir zone of interest, thereby obtaining better resolution than is possible with conventional surface seismic surveys. This technique is often used for high-resolution reservoir characterization when surface seismic or vertical seismic profile (VSP) data lack resolution, or for time-lapse monitoring of fluid movements in the reservoir.",crosswell seismic tomography

Cleanouts using coiled tubing, snubbing or hydraulic workover techniques are performed routinely.",clean out
Formation Evaluation,"A gamma ray interaction in which the gamma ray collides with an electron, transferring part of its energy to the electron, while itself being scattered at a reduced energy. Compton scattering occurs with high probability at intermediate gamma ray energies, between 75 keV and 10 MeV in sedimentary formations. When a beam of gamma rays traverses a material, the total reduction due to Compton scattering depends on the electron density of the material the higher the density, the larger the reduction. This is the basis for the density log. Compton scattering is also an important mechanism in gamma ray detectors.",Compton scattering

Drilling Fluids,"Drilling operations using a water-base drilling fluid that contains few solids. Clear-water drilling is done in hard rocks in which density and fluid loss are not critical. Rapid drilling rate is the incentive for using a solids-free mud. Fluid returned to the surface must be screened and processed by hydrocyclones and centrifuges to remove larger solids. Colloidal solids can be agglomerated by adding polymers and removing the aggregates. Polymers such as acrylates, acrylamides and partially-hydrolyzed polyacrylamides are used. They are added at the flowline as mud exits the well or added in pits downstream from the flowline.",clear water drilling
Reservoir Characterization,"A hypothetical model characterizing strata, generally strata deposited in one or a related set of environments. Conceptual models usually incorporate rules about possible geometries and successions of facies that can be included in a geological scenario.

Conceptual models are often used in conjunction with geostatistical and classical technologies for reservoir characterization.",conceptual model
Drilling,"The rubblized rock just below the tooth of a rock bit. Rock in the crushed zone fails due to the high compressive stress placed on it by the bit tooth (in the case of a roller-cone bit). The effective creation of and removal of crushed zone rock is important to the efficiency of the drill bit. If the rock is not broken and removed efficiently, the result is akin to effectively drilling the hole twice.",crushed zone
Perforating," Well Completions,The rubblized or damaged zone surrounding a perforation tunnel where the action of the perforating charge or bullet has altered the formation structure and permeability. Although it is generally damaging to production, the severity or extent of the crushed zone depend greatly on the characteristics of the formation, the perforating charge and the underbalance or overbalance conditions at time of perforating. Measures to reduce the effect of the crushed zone include underbalanced perforating in which the crushed zone and perforating debris are flushed from the perforating tunnel by the reservoir fluid as soon as the perforation is created.

Geology,"A low-density, high-API gravity liquid hydrocarbon phase that generally occurs in association with natural gas. Its presence as a liquid phase depends on temperature and pressure conditions in the reservoir allowing condensation of liquid from vapor. The production of condensate reservoirs can be complicated because of the pressure sensitivity of some condensates: During production, there is a risk of the condensate changing from gas to liquid if the reservoir pressure drops below the dew point during production. Reservoir pressure can be maintained by fluid injection if gas production is preferable to liquid production. Gas produced in association with condensate is called wet gas.

The drillstring is sometimes filled with nitrogen at a relatively low pressure prior to testing. When the well begins to flow, the nitrogen or air is compressed and the volume of fluid inflow can be calculated as a function of time by monitoring the surface pressure in the drillstring. The bottomhole valve is closed to halt flow when the surface pressure reaches a value calculated prior to testing. This ensures that a precisely known amount of production has taken place.",closed chamber testing

Geology,"Abbreviation for coal seam gas. Natural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases. Production of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates. Coal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines. Coal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited. In these reservoirs, the adsorbed gas is held in place by free gas in the cleats. Consequently, gas production consists of both free gas from the cleat system and desorbed gas from the matrix.",CSG

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A technique used to minimize the rate of corrosion of a structure. Cathodic protection does not eliminate corrosion, it transfers corrosion from the structure under protection to a known location where artificial anodes (plates or metal bars) are placed and could be replaced easily. Cathodic protection is used for floating vessels, platforms, storage tanks and pipelines The cathodic protection principle is based on the electrochemical nature of the corrosion phenomena; the anodic area corrodes (current is discharged) and the cathodic area does not corrode (current is received). Cathodic protection overrides the naturally occurring anodic areas inside a structure, thus turning the structure under protection completely cathodic, which means it receives current from the surrounding electrolyte (for example, soils, water) and does not corrode. Cathodic protection is achieved by passing enough direct current electricity from an external source (a more powerful anode), which could be a galvanic anode or an impressed current anode.",cathodic protection
Drilling Fluids,"A mud and solids-control system in which the only discarded waste is moist, drilled-up rock materials. Such systems are used for drilling wells in environmentally sensitive areas.

A second stage to remove colloidal solids is by wastewater cleanup techniques.",closed mud system
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A gasflood process in which an injection gas enriched with components of intermediate molecular weight, for example butane, is injected into a reservoir to achieve multiple-contact miscibility. Upon contact with the oil, intermediate molecular-weight hydrocarbons transfer from the injected gas phase into the oil phase, a process in which those components are said to condense into the oil. Formation of miscibility may require several contacts between fresh enriched gas and the oil containing condensed components. If the reservoir oil becomes sufficiently enriched with these components that miscibility results between the injection gas and the enriched oil, then the enriched gas and oil have multiple-contact miscibility. A backward multiple-contact test is a laboratory evaluation of a condensing drive process. In the field, both forward- and backward-contact processes can occur during a given gasflood.",condensing drive

Cubic packing is mechanically unstable, but it is the most porous packing arrangement, with about 47% porosity in the ideal situation. Most sediments are not uniform spheres of the same size, nor can they be arranged in a cubic structure naturally, so most sediments have much less than 47% porosity.",cubic packing
Formation Evaluation,"The quantity of positively charged ions (cations) that a clay mineral or similar material can accommodate on its negatively charged surface, expressed as milli-ion equivalent per 100 g, or more commonly as milliequivalent (meq) per 100 g. Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv. In formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ. The multiple salinity and membrane potential methods are more direct measurements of the effect of CEC on formation resistivity and spontaneous potential.",cation exchange capacity

Formation Evaluation,"A model, or set of equations, for the resistivity response of formations with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands. The model is used to analyze core data and to calculate water saturation from resistivity and other logs. The conductive rock matrix model (CRMM) was proposed by W. Givens. The model treats the rock as two components in parallel: a conductive pore network with fluid that is free to move, and the remainder of the rock, which may have conductive minerals or immobile but conductive water. The model is not concerned with the origin of this conductivity, but gives it a resistivity, Rm. The two components are in parallel as follows: 1 / Rt = 1 / Rp + 1 / Rm where Rp is the resistance of the free-fluid pore network and can be expressed in terms of the porosity and formation water resistivity by the Archie equation. The model was developed from core data, and can explain the observed variations of the porosity exponent with porosity and the saturation exponent with water saturation in shaly sands. For log analysis Rm needs to be related to parameters that can be measured by logs.

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for estimating the cation-exchange capacity of a sample by measuring the conductivity of the sample during titration. The technique includes crushing a core sample and mixing it for some time in a solution like barium acetate, during which all the cation-exchange sites are replaced by barium (Ba++) ions. The solution is then titrated with another solution, such as MgSO4, while observing the change in conductivity as the magnesium (Mg++) ions replace the Ba++ ions. For several reasons, but mainly because the sample must be crushed, the measured cation-exchange capacity may differ from that which affects the in situ electrical properties of the rock.",conductometric titration

Drilling,"The casing string that is usually put into the well first, particularly on land wells, to prevent the sides of the hole from caving into the wellbore. This casing, sometimes called drive pipe, is generally a short length and is sometimes driven into the ground.

Offshore, the drive pipe or structural casing may be installed prior to the conductor for similar reasons.",conductor pipe
Well Completions,"A short string of large-diameter casing set to support the surface formations. The conductor pipe is typically set soon after drilling has commenced since the unconsolidated shallow formations can quickly wash out or cave in.

Formation Evaluation,"The effect of a sharp change in the borehole diameter, such as that caused by a cave or rugose hole, on an induction log. In smooth boreholes of constant diameter, the effect of the borehole is well understood and can be corrected for. However, a sharp increase in diameter over a small depth interval can induce signals on one coil in the array and not in others. This signal is not handled by the normal borehole correction and may result in a spike on the log. The spike usually is significant only when the resistivity is high and the contrast between formation and borehole resistivity is very large. The spike also depends on the design of the array or the processing.",cave effect
Reservoir Characterization,Mathematical techniques for summarizing large amounts of multidimensional data into groups. The two most popular techniques are: hierarchicalk-means. The hierarchical system calculates as many clusters as there are data points and displays their relative closeness by means of a dendogram. This system is preferred when there are few data points but the user wishes to see the dendogram to chose an appropriate number of clusters for analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a form of hierarchical cluster analysis. The k-means system requires the user to choose the number of cluster to be determined. The computation scatters the centers of the clusters among the data and then moves them until they are gravitationally bound to the larger groups of data and no longer move. The points determined in this way represent the central points of the clusters. This technique is very fast and appropriate for very large data sets. It is most commonly used in electrofacies calculations. Cluster analysis is often used to provide electrofacies from wireline data where each curve is set to be a dimension.,cluster analysis
Reservoir Characterization,"A projection of data from the apex of a cone in a three-dimensional plot onto a surface at the base of the cone. This projection often is performed in log analysis to remove a dimension and see what a data point would read in the absence of that dimension. For example, removal of shale effects in a plot of neutron, density and gamma ray data helps determine the mineralogy of a sample where the apex of the cone would represent the shale point in the plot. The M-N plot is a plot in which the fluid has been removed by conical projection from the neutron, density and sonic data to provide a porosity-independent plot that can be used to determine lithology.",conical projection

Drilling,"A method for recovering wireline stuck in a wellbore. In cut-and-thread operations, the wireline is gripped securely with a special tool and cut at the surface. The cut end is threaded through a stand of drillpipe. While the pipe hangs in the wellbore, the wireline is threaded through another stand of drillpipe, which is screwed onto the stand in the wellbore. The process is repeated until the stuck wireline is recovered. This technique, while dangerous and time-consuming, is known to improve greatly the chances of full recovery of the wireline and the tool at its end in the shortest overall time compared with trying to grab the wireline in the openhole with fishing tools.",cut and thread fishing technique

Geology,"Abbreviation for coalbed methane. Natural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases. Production of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates. Coal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines. Coal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited. In these reservoirs, the adsorbed gas is held in place by free gas in the cleats. Consequently, gas production consists of both free gas from the cleat system and desorbed gas from the matrix.",CBM

Drilling,"The material used to permanently seal annular spaces between casing and borehole walls. Cement is also used to seal formations to prevent loss of drilling fluid and for operations ranging from setting kick-off plugs to plug and abandonment. The most common type by far is API Oilwell Cement, known informally as Portland cement. Generally speaking, oilfield cement is thinner and exhibits far less strength than cement or concrete used for construction due to the requirement that it be highly pumpable in relatively narrow annulus over long distances. Various additives are used to control density, setting time, strength and flow properties. Additionally, special additives are often used to reduce the occurrence of annular gas flow. The cement slurry, commonly formed by mixing Portland cement, water and assorted dry and liquid additives, is pumped into place and allowed to solidify (typically for 12 to 24 hours) before additional drilling activity can resume. The cement usually must reach a strength of 5000 psi [34,474 KPa] before drilling or perforating.

Surface roughness affects the equilibrium contact angle, so measurements are typically made on smooth, flat surfaces. A contact-angle test uses carefully captured and preserved samples of reservoir oil to determine the wetting preference. A droplet of the crude oil is suspended between two parallel plates of quartz or calcite inside a simulated formation water bath at reservoir temperature and sometimes at reservoir pressure. By periodically displacing one of the plates sideways, a contact angle is determined at the side of the droplet where water is forcing the oil from the solid. A small angle indicates water-wetting preference, while a large angle indicates oil-wetting. Angles near 90 degrees are intermediate-wetting. Different minerals display different wetting preferences, although most are more likely to be water-wet.",contact angle
Drilling Fluids,"The elapsed time for mud to circulate from the suction pit, down the wellbore and back to surface. Cycle time allows the mud engineer to catch in and out samples that accurately represent the same element of mud in a circulating system. Cycle time is calculated from the estimated hole volume and pump rate and can be checked by using tracers such as carbide or rice granules.",cycle time
Drilling,"A representation of the integrity of the cement job, especially whether the cement is adhering solidly to the outside of the casing. The log is typically obtained from one of a variety of sonic-type tools. The newer versions, called cement evaluation logs, along with their processing software, can give detailed, 360-degree representations of the integrity of the cement job, whereas older versions may display a single line representing the integrated integrity around the casing.",cement evaluation log
Geology,"Natural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases. Production of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates. Coal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines. Coal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited. In these reservoirs, the adsorbed gas is held in place by free gas in the cleats. Consequently, gas production consists of both free gas from the cleat system and desorbed gas from the matrix.",coal seam gas
Drilling Fluids,The elapsed time required for a specific fluid to pass a designated depth or point in the annulus during pumping operations. Contact time is normally used as a design criterion for mud removal in turbulent flow.,contact time
Heavy Oil,"A method of thermal recovery in which a well is injected with steam and then subsequently put back on production. A cyclic steam-injection process includes three stages. The first stage is injection, during which a slug of steam is introduced into the reservoir. The second stage, or soak phase, requires that the well be shut in for several days to allow uniform heat distribution to thin the oil. Finally, during the third stage, the thinned oil is produced through the same well. The cycle is repeated as long as oil production is profitable. Cyclic steam injection is used extensively in heavy-oil reservoirs, tar sands, and in some cases to improve injectivity prior to steamflood or in situ combustion operations. Cyclic steam injection is also called steam soak or the huff `n puff (slang) method.",cyclic steam injection
Well Completions,"A chemical additive or inert material used to decrease the density or increase the yield of a cement slurry. The slurry yield is typically expressed in cubic feet of slurry per sack of cement. Increasing the yield reduces the cost per volume of cement slurry, while reducing the slurry density reduces the hydrostatic pressure of the cement column, enabling weak zones to be successfully cemented and isolated.",cement extender

Well Workover and Intervention,"A chemical or fluid that alters the performance of an engineered slurry or treatment fluid. Some remedial cementing treatments require unpredictable volumes of cement slurry to achieve the desired results. When excess slurry is left in the wellbore, it may not be possible to remove the excess slurry by conventional means, such as reverse circulation, before the slurry thickens and becomes immovable. Mixing the contaminant with the slurry in the correct proportions increases the thickening time of the slurry, allowing it to be safely removed from the wellbore.",contaminant
Production Facilities,"An oilfield installation used when producing from a gas-condensate reservoir. In a cycling plant, the liquids are extracted from the natural gas and then the remaining dry gas is compressed and returned to the producing formation to maintain reservoir pressure. This process increases the ultimate recovery of liquids.",cycling plant
Drilling,"A device fitted to the top joint of a casing string to hold a cement plug before it is pumped down the casing during the cementing operation. In most operations, a bottom plug is launched before the spacer or cement slurry. The top plug is released from the cement head after the spacer fluid. Most cement heads can hold both the top and bottom plugs. A manifold incorporated into the cement head assembly allows connection of a fluid circulation line.",cement head

Reservoir Characterization,"A succession of strata deposited during a single cycle of deposition. These sedimentary successions usually occur repeatedly, one above the other. The two main varieties are the cyclic units that are symmetrical cyclothems, and the rhythmic units that are asymmetrical cyclothems. Cyclic groupings of cyclothems are called megacyclothems, and cyclic groupings of megacyclothems are called hypercyclothems. Cyclothems are thought to be due to natural cycles, such as changes in sea levels related to changes in the volume of polar ice caps.",cyclothem

Drilling Fluids,"To grow, as in the process of droplet growth, through small drops merging when they come in contact. If this occurs repeatedly, a continuous liquid phase forms. Through this phenomenon, emulsions break and form two distinct liquid phases that tend to separate. In oil-base mud, the water phase is dispersed as small droplets, with oil as the continuous (external) phase. A stable oil mud will remain dispersed under normal drilling conditions because when droplets contact each other, they do not coalesce due to the strong emulsifier film around each droplet. However, when the emulsion film around each droplet becomes weakened, droplets will begin to coalesce. If not corrected, this can lead to total emulsion breakdown with solids becoming water-wetted.",coalesce
Geology,"Continental shelf, or the area at the edges of a continent from the shoreline to a depth of 200 m [660 ft], where the continental slope begins. The shelf is commonly a wide, flat area with a slight seaward slope. The term is sometimes used as a for platform.",continental shelf

Well Completions,"An isolation tool set in the casing or liner that enables treatments to be applied to a lower interval while providing isolation from the annulus above. Cement retainers are typically used in cement squeeze or similar remedial treatments. A specially profiled probe, known as a stinger, is attached to the bottom of the tubing string to engage in the retainer during operation. When the stinger is removed, the valve assembly isolates the wellbore below the cement retainer.",cement retainer

The need for cement retardation increases with depth due to the greater time required to complete the cementing operation and the effect of increased temperature on the cement-setting process.,cement retarder
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Natural or induced production impairments that can develop in the reservoir, the near-wellbore area, the perforations, the gravel-pack completion or the production pipelines, such as the tubing. Natural damage occurs as produced reservoir fluids move through the reservoir, while induced damage is the result of external operations and fluids in the well, such as drilling, well completion, workover operations or stimulation treatments. Some induced damage triggers natural damage mechanisms. Natural damage includes phenomena such as fines migration, clay swelling, scale formation, organic deposition, including paraffins or asphaltenes, and mixed organic and inorganic deposition. Induced damage includes plugging caused by foreign particles in the injected fluid, wettability changes, emulsions, precipitates or sludges caused by acid reactions, bacterial activity and water blocks. Wellbore cleanup or matrix stimulation treatments are two different operations that can remove natural or induced damage. Selecting the proper operation depends on the location and nature of the damage.",damage
Reservoir Characterization,"Logs that have been calculated from other logs to find the rate at which a log is changing with depth. For example, the derivative caliper (rugosity) calculates the rate at which the caliper is changing from one depth to another. Bad hole conditions that cause the density log to produce incorrect measurements are usually more closely related to the rugosity of the hole than the hole size, so the rugosity curve is the more useful in this regard.",derivative logs
Drilling Fluids,"The instrument used to measure viscosity and gel strength of drilling mud. The direct-indicating viscometer is a rotational cylinder and bob instrument, also known as a V-G meter. Two speeds of rotation, 300 and 600 rpm, are available in all instruments, but some are 6- or variable-speed. It is called direct-indicating because at a given speed, the dial reading is a true centipoise viscosity. For example, at 300 rpm, the dial reading (511 sec-1) is a true viscosity. Bingham plastic rheological parameters are easily calculated from direct-indicating viscometer readings: PV (in units of cp) = 600 dial - 300 dial and YP (in units of lb/100 ft2) = 300 dial - PV. Gel strength is also directly read as dial readings in oilfield units of lb/100 ft2.",direct indicating viscometer
Well Testing,"The measurement and analysis of pressure data taken after a well is put on production, either initially or following an extended shut-in period. Drawdown data are usually noisy, meaning that the pressure moves up and down as fluid flows past the gauges and minute variations in flow rate take place. This is especially true for new wells, in which well cleanup commonly occurs for days after production has begun. Such data are difficult to interpret, and the noise often obscures regions of interest to the analyst. Transient downhole flow rates measured while flowing can be used to correct pressure variations through convolution or deconvolution calculations that enable diagnosis and interpretation, analogous to that done for the pressure change and derivative.",drawdown test
Perforating," Well Completions,The area surrounding the wellbore that has been harmed by the drilling process, generally as a result of mud or cement-filtrate invasion. Near-wellbore damage can significantly affect productivity and is typically easier to prevent than it is to cure. Although almost always present, a lightly damaged zone around the wellbore can be bypassed by perforation tunnels to create connecting conduits from the wellbore to the undamaged reservoir formation. More severe cases of damage may require a matrix-acidizing treatment to restore the natural permeability, or a hydraulic fracturing treatment to create a new high-conductivity flow path to the reservoir.",damaged zone
Drilling,"The structure used to support the crown blocks and the drillstring of a drilling rig. Derricks are usually pyramidal in shape, and offer a good strength-to-weight ratio. If the derrick design does not allow it to be moved easily in one piece, special ironworkers must assemble them piece by piece, and in some cases disassemble them if they are to be moved.",derrick
Drilling,"The machine on the rig consisting of a large-diameter steel spool, brakes, a power source and assorted auxiliary devices. The primary function of the drawworks is to reel out and reel in the drilling line, a large diameter wire rope, in a controlled fashion. The drilling line is reeled over the crown block and traveling block to gain mechanical advantage in a block and tackle or pulley fashion. This reeling out and in of the drilling line causes the traveling block, and whatever may be hanging underneath it, to be lowered into or raised out of the wellbore. The reeling out of the drilling line is powered by gravity and reeling in by an electric motor or diesel engine.",drawworks
Geophysics,"The opposition, slowing or prevention of oscillation, or decreasing vibration amplitude, as kinetic energy dissipates. Frictional damping can be important in the use of geophones for seismic surveys, since a vibrating instrument is difficult to read. Eddy currents can produce electromagnetic damping. The classic example of damping from physics is the slowing of a swinging pendulum unless it has a steady supply of energy.",damping
Drilling,"The relatively small work area in which the rig crew conducts operations, usually adding or removing drillpipe to or from the drillstring. The rig floor is the most dangerous location on the rig because heavy iron is moved around there. Drillstring connections are made or broken on the drillfloor, and the driller's console for controlling the major components of the rig are located there. Attached to the rig floor is a small metal room, the doghouse, where the rig crew can meet, take breaks and take refuge from the elements during idle times.",derrick floor
Drilling,"An individual trained in the science and art of intentionally drilling a well along a predetermined path in three-dimensional space, usually involving deviating the well from vertical and directing it in a specific compass direction or heading. The directional driller considers such parameters as rotary speed, weight on bit, control drilling and when to stop drilling and take surveys of the wellpath, and works closely with the toolpusher.",directional driller
Drilling,A term to describe the inclination from vertical of a wellbore.,drift
Drilling,"To guarantee the inside diameter of a pipe or other cylindrical tool by pulling a cylinder or pipe (often called a rabbit) of known outside diameter through it. The drift diameter is the inside diameter (ID) that the pipe manufacturer guarantees per specifications. Note that the nominal inside diameter is not the same as the drift diameter but is always slightly larger. The drift diameter is used by the well planner to determine what size tools or casing strings can later be run through the casing, whereas the nominal inside diameter is used for fluid volume calculations such as mud circulating times and cement slurry placement calculations.",drift
Drilling,"To pass a gauge through casing, tubulars and completion components to ensure minimum-diameter specifications are within tolerance, as described in definition 2. This task is also performed to ensure that there is no junk, dried cement, dirt, rocks or other debris inside the pipe.",drift

Reservoir Characterization,A standard unit of measure of permeability. One darcy describes the permeability of a porous medium through which the passage of one cubic centimeter of fluid having one centipoise of viscosity flowing in one second under a pressure differential of one atmosphere where the porous medium has a cross-sectional area of one square centimeter and a length of one centimeter. A millidarcy (mD) is one thousandth of a darcy and is a commonly used unit for reservoir rocks.,darcy
Drilling,"One of the rig crew members who gets his name from the fact that he works on a platform attached to the derrick or mast, typically 85 ft [26 m] above the rig floor, during trips. On small land drilling crews, the derrickman is second in rank to the driller. Larger offshore crews may have an assistant driller between the derrickman and the driller. In a typical trip out of the hole (TOH), the derrickman wears a special safety harness that enables him to lean out from the work platform (called the monkeyboard) to reach the drillpipe in the center of the derrick or mast, throw a line around the pipe and pull it back into its storage location (the fingerboards) until it is time to run the pipe back into the well. In terms of skill, physical exertion and perceived danger, a derrickman has one of the most demanding jobs on the rig crew. Some modern drilling rigs have automated pipe-handling equipment such that the derrickman controls the machinery rather than physically handling the pipe. In an emergency, the derrickman can quickly reach the ground by an escape line often called the Geronimo line.",derrickman
Drilling Fluids,"The member of the drilling crew in charge of the mud-processing area during periods of circulation. The derrickman also measures mud density and conducts the Marsh funnel viscosity test on a regular basis when the mud is circulating in the hole. The derrickman reports to the toolpusher, but is instructed in detail by the mud engineer on what to add to the mud, how fast and how much. His other job is to handle pipe in the derrick while pulling out or running into the hole.",derrickman
Drilling," Shale Gas,The intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take. This is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken downhole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components and drill bits, including rotary steerable systems, and drill bits. The directional driller also exploits drilling parameters such as weight on bit and rotary speed to deflect the bit away from the axis of the existing wellbore. In some cases, such as drilling steeply dipping formations or unpredictable deviation in conventional drilling operations, directional-drilling techniques may be employed to ensure that the hole is drilled vertically. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: point the bit in the direction that one wants to drill. The most common way is through the use of a bend near the bit in a downhole steerable mud motor. The bend points the bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit turns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that direction may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) so that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the wellbore axis, but instead sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating, usually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes. Directional drilling is common in shale reservoirs because it allows drillers to place the borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock.",directional drilling
Drilling,"The tool used to crush or cut rock. Everything on a drilling rig directly or indirectly assists the bit in crushing or cutting the rock. The bit is on the bottom of the drillstring and must be changed when it becomes excessively dull or stops making progress. Most bits work by scraping or crushing the rock, or both, usually as part of a rotational motion. Some bits, known as hammer bits, pound the rock vertically in much the same fashion as a construction site air hammer.",drill bit
Well Testing,"Units of atm, cm3/s, cp and D, as originally used by Darcy in flow experiments.",Darcy units
Drilling,"A hydrocyclone device that removes large drill solids from the whole mud system. The desander should be located downstream of the shale shakers and degassers, but before the desilters or mud cleaners. A volume of mud is pumped into the wide upper section of the hydrocylone at an angle roughly tangent to its circumference. As the mud flows around and gradually down the inside of the cone shape, solids are separated from the liquid by centrifugal forces. The solids continue around and down until they exit the bottom of the hydrocyclone (along with small amounts of liquid) and are discarded. The cleaner and lighter density liquid mud travels up through a vortex in the center of the hydrocyclone, exits through piping at the top of the hydrocyclone and is then routed to the mud tanks and the next mud-cleaning device, usually a desilter. Various size desander and desilter cones are functionally identical, with the size of the cone determining the size of particles the device removes from the mud system.",desander
Well Testing,"Permeability that varies with direction of flow through the porous medium. Lateral permeability contrast can be particularly important in fractured formations, where effective permeability in the direction of the fractures may be many times greater than the matrix permeability. If the permeability in one direction is significantly more than in the other, the flow pattern may more closely approximate linear flow than radial flow. This can be detected from well-test data. Likewise, laminations in most clastic formations cause the permeability normal to the bedding plane to be less than the lateral permeability parallel to bedding. This is called vertical to horizontal permeability anisotropy.",directional permeability
Drilling,"A component of a drillstring that provides weight on bit for drilling. Drill collars are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. The bars of steel are drilled from end to end to provide a passage to pumping drilling fluids through the collars. The outside diameter of the steel bars may be machined slightly to ensure roundness, and in some cases may be machined with helical grooves (spiral collars). Last, threaded connections, male on one end and female on the other, are cut so multiple collars can be screwed together along with other downhole tools to make a bottomhole assembly (BHA). Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off the bottom of the wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds [9080 kg] less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Downhole MWD sensors measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.",drill collar
Well Workover and Intervention,A device dropped or pumped through a tubing or coiled tubing string to activate downhole equipment and tools.,dart
Production Facilities,"A substance used in a gas-dehydration unit to remove water and moisture. The desiccant can be liquid, such as methanol, glycol (ethylene, diethylene, triethylene, and tetraethylene). Desiccants also can be solid, such as silica gel or calcium chloride [CaCl2]. The most common gas-dehydration system (glycol dehydrator) uses liquid desiccants such as diethylene, triethylene and tetraethylene, which are substances that can be regenerated. Regeneration means that the water absorbed by these substances can be separated from them. Some liquid desiccants such as methanol or ethylene cannot be regenerated. Solid desiccants are also used for gas dehydration. They are placed as beds through which wet gas is passed. The main limitation of the use of solid desiccants is that they absorb only limited quantities of water. When the desiccant saturation point is reached, the solid desiccant must be replaced. Another limitation is that sometimes water cannot be removed from it.",desiccant
Drilling,"A completed measurement of the inclination and azimuth of a location in a well (typically the total depth at the time of measurement). In both directional and straight holes, the position of the well must be known with reasonable accuracy to ensure the correct wellbore path and to know its position in the event a relief well must be drilled. The measurements themselves include inclination from vertical, and the azimuth (or compass heading) of the wellbore if the direction of the path is critical. These measurements are made at discrete points in the well, and the approximate path of the wellbore computed from the discrete points. Measurement devices range from simple pendulum-like devices to complex electronic accelerometers and gyroscopes used more often as MWD becomes more popular. In simple pendulum measurements, the position of a freely hanging pendulum relative to a measurement grid (attached to the housing of the tool and assumed to represent the path of the wellbore) is captured on photographic film. The film is developed and examined when the tool is removed from the wellbore, either on wireline or the next time pipe is tripped out of the hole.",directional survey
Drilling Fluids,"A special fluid designed exclusively for drilling through the reservoir section of a wellbore. The reasons for using a specially designed mud are: (1) to drill the reservoir zone successfully, often a long, horizontal drainhole. (2) to minimize damage and maximize production of exposed zones. (3) to facilitate the well completion needed, which can include complicated procedures. A drill-in fluid should resemble a completion fluid. It may be a brine containing only selected solids of appropriate particle size ranges (salt crystals or calcium carbonate) and polymers. Only additives essential for filtration control and cuttings carrying are present in a drill-in fluid.",drill in fluid
Formation Evaluation,"The rate at which measurements are transmitted between logging tool and surface. In measurement-while-drilling (MWD), if the data rate is low in comparison with the drilling or tripping speed, the sampling interval or the amount of data transmitted must be reduced or else information will be lost.

Drilling,"A hydrocyclone much like a desander except that its design incorporates a greater number of smaller cones. As with the desander, its purpose is to remove unwanted solids from the mud system. The smaller cones allow the desilter to efficiently remove smaller diameter drill solids than a desander does. For that reason, the desilter is located downstream from the desander in the surface mud system.",desilter
Reservoir Characterization,"Variograms and semivariograms that have a directional component in addition to the normal distance component. Directional variograms and semivariograms are commonly used where geological features are heterogeneous. For example, fluvial environments dominated by valleys, channels and point bars are likely to have directional components that are detectable and that will influence the behavior of fluids in these formations. Geostatistical models that use directional variograms can be expected to be more reliable in these circumstances.",directional variograms
Geophysics,"A technique for acquiring a vertical seismic profile that uses the noise of the drill bit as a source and receivers laid out along the ground or seabed. In deep water, the receiver arrays can be deployed vertically. Acquisition and processing are typically more challenging than in the more conventional types of VSPs, but the technique can yield time-depth information and, less frequently, reflection information, while the well is being drilled. The information from a drill-noise VSP can be used to improve time-depth conversions while drilling, decide where to set casing in a well and evaluate drilling hazards, such as anomalous pore pressure.",drill noise vertical seismic profile
Geophysics,"An agreed and known value, such as the elevation of a benchmark or sea level, to which other measurements are corrected.

Geophysics,"The property of some seismic sources whereby the amplitude, frequency, velocity or other property of the resulting seismic waves varies with direction. A directional charge, such as a length of primer cord or a linear array of charges, can be used when directivity is desirable. Directivity is also a property of geophone arrays, air guns, explosives or vibrators, which can be positioned to reduce horizontal traveling noise such as ground roll. Receivers in the form of groups in which the individual geophones or hydrophones are separated from each other in linear (1D) or areal (2D) arrays are directional, and are designed to suppress signal arriving nearly horizontally and to pass nearly vertical arrivals with minimum attenuation or distortion. Directivity is often present, but the difficulty in accounting for it during seismic processing makes it undesirable in most cases.",directivity
Drilling,"A maritime vessel modified to include a drilling rig and special station-keeping equipment. The vessel is typically capable of operating in deep water. A drillship must stay relatively stationary on location in the water for extended periods of time.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The ability of a chemical agent to remove a contaminant from a solid surface. For example, in enhanced oil recovery, a surfactant can be used to remove an oil phase from a mineral surface. At least two mechanisms can occur: a) The surfactant adsorbs on the contaminated surface and presents its hydrophilic group to the contacting liquid. Thus, the surface behaves hydrophilically and repels macroscopic oil drops. b) The surfactant adsorbs to the contaminant. It is energetically more favorable for the combination of surfactant and contaminant to be in solution than to be attached to the surface so the contaminant is solubilized, exposing the mineral surface.",detergency

Drilling Fluids,"Formation solids contained in a mud system, generally considered to be detrimental to the drilling operation because they produce high plastic viscosity, yield point and gel strengths and build poor-quality filter cakes. They also occupy space that is needed for barite in high-density muds. Drill solids cause excessive wear in the mud pumps and other rig equipment. Solids control is aimed at economically and efficiently removing drill solids. This implies removal as soon as possible after they enter the mud system, while the particles are at their largest size.",drilled solids

Most drillers have worked their way up from other rigsite jobs. While the driller must know how to perform each of the jobs on the rig, his or her role is to supervise the work and control the major rig systems. The driller operates the pumps, drawworks, and rotary table via the drillers console-a control room of gauges, control levers, rheostats, and other pneumatic, hydraulic and electronic instrumentation. The driller also operates the drawworks brake using a long-handled lever. Hence, the driller is sometimes referred to as the person who is on the brake.",driller

Clay dispersants are various sodium phosphates and sodium carbonates aided by heat, mechanical shearing and time. Powdered polymers are dispersed by precoating the particles with a type of glycol to prevent formation of fish-eye globules. For dispersing (emulsification) of oil into water (or water into oils), surfactants selected on the basis of hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) number can be used. For foam drilling fluids, synthetic detergents and soaps are used, along with polymers, to disperse foam bubbles into the air or gas.",dispersant

Production Logging,"A multiphase flow regime in pipes in which one fluid moves as small dispersed bubbles through a continuous fluid. The relative velocity of the bubbles depends mainly on the difference in density between the two fluids. Bubble flow normally occurs at low flow rate and low holdup of the bubbly fluid. As the velocity of the continuous fluid increases, the bubbles are dispersed into smaller, more widely separated bubbles. This is known as a dispersed or finely dispersed bubble flow, or sometimes dispersed flow.",dispersed bubble flow
Formation Evaluation,"A method for the measurement of fluid saturations in a core sample by distillation extraction. The water in the sample is vaporized by boiling solvent, then condensed and collected in a calibrated trap. This gives the volume of water in the sample. The solvent is also condensed, then flows back over the sample and extracts the oil. Extraction continues for a minimum of two days until the extracted solvent is clean or the sample shows no more fluorescence. The weight of the sample is measured before and after extraction. Then the volume of oil is calculated from the loss in weight of the sample minus the weight of the water removed from it. Saturations are calculated from the volumes.",Dean Stark extraction

Drilling,"A sudden increase in the rate of penetration during drilling. When this increase is significant (two or more times the normal speed, depending on local conditions), it may indicate a formation change, a change in the pore pressure of the formation fluids, or both. It is commonly interpreted as an indication of the bit drilling sand (high-speed drilling) rather than shale (low-speed drilling). The fast-drilling formation may or may not contain high-pressure fluids. Therefore, the driller commonly stops drilling and performs a flow check to determine if the formation is flowing. If the well is flowing, or if the results are uncertain, the driller may close the blowout preventers or circulate bottoms-up. Depending on the bit being used and the formations being drilled, a formation, even if sand, may sometimes drill slower rather than faster. This slowing of drilling progress, while technically also a drilling break, is usually referred to as a reverse drilling break, or simply reverse break.",drilling break

Perforating,A device containing primary high-explosive material that is used to initiate an explosive sequence. The two common types of detonators are electrical detonators (also known as blasting caps) and percussion detonators. Electrical detonators have a fuse material that burns when high voltage is applied to initiate the primary high explosive. Percussion detonators contain abrasive grit and primary high explosive in a sealed container that is activated by a firing pin. The impact force of the firing pin is sufficient to initiate the ballistic sequence that is then transmitted to the detonating cord. Several safety systems are used in conjunction with detonators to avoid accidental firing during rig-up or rig-down. Safety systems also are used to disarm the gun or ballistic assembly if downhole conditions are unsafe for firing.,detonator

Each frequency component travels at its phase velocity (vp), which is the product of the frequency (f) and wavelength (λ) of that component.

Dispersion affects all types of waves, including light, electromagnetic, sound, elastic, gravity and water waves.",dispersion
Drilling Fluids,"The act of breaking up large particles into smaller ones and distributing them throughout a liquid or gaseous medium. For example, in water-base drilling mud, dispersion is the act of degrading clay materials, starches, carboxymethylcellulose, biopolymer, synthetic polymers or oils into submicroscopic particles by applying mechanical energy, heat or chemical means. In oil-mud emulsion terminology, dispersion is the act of forming a fine-grained emulsion of an aqueous phase into an oil. This is usually accomplished with by mechanical shearing or heating in the presence of surfactants. It also includes dispersing solids into an oil mud, such as barite or organophilic clays. Mud viscosity increases as more and more platelets are dispersed. No gel structure can form as long as mechanical shearing is in progress.",dispersion

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Spatial separation of components within a fluid. This separation is often driven by diffusion, mixing or differential flow. In an oil field components might be separated because of heterogeneity of permeability, or simply because of different paths taken by the fluid through the pore structure.

The components of an enhanced oil recovery formulation can also be dispersed within a porous rock via differential adsorption properties (chromatographic effects).",dispersion
Drilling,"The company that owns and operates a drilling rig. The drilling contractor usually charges a fixed daily rate for its hardware (the rig) and software (the people), plus certain extraordinary expenses. Under this arrangement, the cost of the well is largely a function of the time it takes to drill and complete the well. The other primary contracting methods are footage rates (where the contractor receives an agreed upon amount per foot of hole drilled), or turnkey operations, where the contractor may assume substantial risk of the operations and receives a lump sum payment upon supplying a well of a given specification to the operator.",drilling contractor

Drilling,"The act of removing one fluid (usually liquid) from a wellbore and replacing it with another. This is accomplished by pumping a spacer fluid that is benign to both the first and second fluid, followed by the new fluid, down the drillstring and out the bottom of the drillstring or bit. While the spacer and second fluid are pumped into the top of the wellbore, the first fluid is forced out of the annulus between the drillstring and the wellbore or casing. In some cases, this general procedure may be reversed by pumping in the top of the annulus and taking fluid back from the drillstring. Since this is the reverse of the normal circulation path, this is referred to as reversing out or reverse circulation.",displacement
Drilling,"The act of forcing a cement slurry that has been pumped into a casing string or drillstring to exit the bottom of the casing or drillstring by pumping another fluid behind it. Cement displacement is similar to definition 5 above, with the noted exception that the cement slurry would not normally be pumped out the top of the annulus, but would instead be placed in a particular location in the annulus. This location might be the entire annulus on a short casing string, or filling only a bottom portion of the casing on longer casing strings.",displacement
Drilling,"Personnel who operate the drilling rig. The crew typically consists of roustabouts, roughnecks, floor hands, lead tong operators, motormen, derrickmen, assistant drillers, and the driller. Since drilling rigs operate around the clock, there are at least two crews (twelve hour work shifts called tours, more common when operating offshore), or three crews (eight hour tours, more common onshore). In addition, drilling contractors must be able to supply relief crews from time to time when crew members are unavailable.

The term refers to early 6FF40 and deep induction logs in which the standard method of deconvolution was based on three measurements separated by 78 in. [198 cm] in depth. The three measurements were weighted by an amount calculated to reduce the effect of shoulder beds on the readings in a high-resistivity bed. Originally, the resistivity of the shoulder beds could be input, but in later usage this resistivity became standardized at 1 ohm-m. The deconvolution was not effective in high-contrast formations. In modern tools, the shoulder effect is corrected by using an inverse filter or an automatic inversion.",deconvolution
Well Testing,"A mathematical operation that uses downhole flow-rate measurements to transform bottomhole pressure measurements distorted by variable rates to an interpretable transient. Deconvolution also can use surface rates to transform wellhead pressures to an interpretable form.

Shale Gas," Drilling,The intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take. This is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken downhole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components and drill bits, including rotary steerable systems, and drill bits. The directional driller also exploits drilling parameters such as weight on bit and rotary speed to deflect the bit away from the axis of the existing wellbore. In some cases, such as drilling steeply dipping formations or unpredictable deviation in conventional drilling operations, directional-drilling techniques may be employed to ensure that the hole is drilled vertically. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: point the bit in the direction that one wants to drill. The most common way is through the use of a bend near the bit in a downhole steerable mud motor. The bend points the bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit turns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that direction may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) so that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the wellbore axis, but instead sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating, usually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes. Directional drilling is common in shale reservoirs because it allows drillers to place the borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock.",deviated drilling

Drilling,"A completed measurement of the inclination and azimuth of a location in a well (typically the total depth at the time of measurement). In both directional and straight holes, the position of the well must be known with reasonable accuracy to ensure the correct wellbore path and to know its position in the event a relief well must be drilled. The measurements themselves include inclination from vertical, and the azimuth (or compass heading) of the wellbore if the direction of the path is critical. These measurements are made at discrete points in the well, and the approximate path of the wellbore computed from the discrete points. Measurement devices range from simple pendulum-like devices to complex electronic accelerometers and gyroscopes used more often as MWD becomes more popular. In simple pendulum measurements, the position of a freely hanging pendulum relative to a measurement grid (attached to the housing of the tool and assumed to represent the path of the wellbore) is captured on photographic film.

Longer exposure to higher temperatures during diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis generally results in transformation of the kerogen into liquid hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon gases.",diagenesis

Drilling Fluids,"A clay-based, water mud that has had its viscosity reduced with a chemical treatment; incorrectly, called a dispersed mud. The chemical used is a deflocculant, not a dispersant. A well-known and effective clay deflocculant is lignosulfonate. The mud, after being deflocculated, usually shows much improved filter-cake qualities with lower yield point and gel strengths. Filter-cake quality is improved because when clays are deflocculated, the platelets become detached from each other and can lie flat to form a thin, low-permeability filter cake. Lowering yield point and gel strength may not always be desired and can be adjusted by the amount of deflocculant added in each treatment. If yield point and gels are lowered too far, suspension and cutting capacity of the mud are impaired.",deflocculated mud
Geology,"Pertaining to diagenesis, which is the physical, chemical or biological alteration of sediments into sedimentary rock at relatively low temperatures and pressures that can result in changes to the rock's original mineralogy and texture. After deposition, sediments are compacted as they are buried beneath successive layers of sediment and cemented by minerals that precipitate from solution. Grains of sediment, rock fragments and fossils can be replaced by other minerals during diagenesis. Porosity usually decreases during diagenesis, except in rare cases such as dissolution of minerals and dolomitization. Diagenesis does not include weathering processes. Hydrocarbon generation begins during diagenesis. There is not a clear, accepted distinction between diagenesis and metamorphism, although metamorphism occurs at pressures and temperatures higher than those of the outer crust, where diagenesis occurs",diagenetic

Well Workover and Intervention,"A technique used in injection treatments, such as matrix stimulation, to ensure a uniform distribution of treatment fluid across the treatment interval. Injected fluids tend to follow the path of least resistance, possibly resulting in the least permeable areas receiving inadequate treatment. By using some means of diversion, the treatment can be focused on the areas requiring the most treatment. To be effective, the diversion effect should be temporary to enable the full productivity of the well to be restored when the treatment is complete.

Antifoam agents may also be used to break foams returned from the wellbore, following a treatment, in preparation for disposal of the fluids.",defoamer
Formation Evaluation,"The distance from the borehole wall into the formation that the mud filtrate has penetrated. The term assumes equal invasion on all sides of the borehole. It is the diameter of the circle thus formed, with the center being the center of the borehole. The diameter of invasion affects whether a log measures the invaded zone, the undisturbed zone, or part of each zone. The term is closely related to the depth of invasion, being twice the depth of invasion plus the borehole diameter. Diameter of invasion is a more appropriate parameter for describing the response of azimuthally symmetric measurements such as induction, laterolog and propagation resistivity. The term is well-defined in the case of a step profile of invasion. In the case of an annulus or a transition zone, two diameters must be defined, corresponding to the inner and outer limits of the annulus or transition zone. When the invasion model is not specified, the term usually refers to the outer limit of invasion.",diameter of invasion

Production Logging,"A device for measuring in-situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the total fluid flow is diverted to pass over an impeller, or spinner. Various techniques have been used to achieve this, one of the earliest being the packer flowmeter. In a typical modern device, the diverter consists of a fabric in a metal cage that is collapsed to pass through the tubing and other restrictions. Below the tubing, the cage is opened until an inflatable ring seals against the casing wall. At this point, the up-going production fluids are forced through the diverter and over an impeller. This ensures that the total casing flow is measured, but may also create an extra pressure drop and hence a change in multiphase flow structure. The diverter flowmeter is particularly suitable for low flow rates in vertical or moderately deviated wells. Readings are made with the tool stationary.",diverter flowmeter

Drilling,"A device that removes air or gases (methane, H2S, CO2 and others) from drilling liquids. There are two generic types that work by both expanding the size of the gas bubbles entrained in the mud (by pulling a vacuum on the mud) and by increasing the surface area available to the mud so that bubbles escape (through the use of various cascading baffle plates). If the gas content in the mud is high, a mud gas separator or poor boy degasser is used, because it has a higher capacity than standard degassers and routes the evolved gases away from the rig to a flaring area complete with an ignition source.",degasser
Drilling,"A tool for drilling rock that works by scraping industrial grade diamonds against the bottom of the hole. The diamonds are embedded into the metal structure (usually a sintered or powdered carbide base matrix) during the manufacture of the bit. The bit designer has virtually unlimited combinations of bit shape, the placement of hydraulic jetting ports, the amount of diamonds and the size of the diamonds used (usually expressed as diamonds per carat). In general, a diamond bit that drills faster has a shorter lifetime. Similarly, a bit designed for extremely long life will typically drill at a slower rate. If a bit has a relatively high number of diamonds compared with other bits, it is said to be heavy-set and has higher durability. A light-set bit, on the other hand, drills more aggressively, but wears out faster because fewer diamonds do the work.",diamond bit
Well Workover and Intervention," Well Completions,A chemical agent used in stimulation treatments to ensure uniform injection over the area to be treated. Diverting agents, also known as chemical diverters, function by creating a temporary blocking effect that is safely cleaned up following the treatment, enabling enhanced productivity throughout the treated interval. In matrix acidizing of injection wells, benzoic acid is used as a chemical diverter, while oil-soluble resins are employed in production wells. Both compounds are slightly soluble or inert in the acidic medium [HCl], but after functioning as diverters, they dissolve with water injection or oil production, respectively. Stable, viscous foams generated in the rock matrix are also considered to be chemical diverters.",diverting agent
Drilling,"A procedure to determine the productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent (or a combination of these) of a hydrocarbon reservoir. While several different proprietary hardware sets are available to accomplish this, the common idea is to isolate the zone of interest with temporary packers. Next, one or more valves are opened to produce the reservoir fluids through the drillpipe and allow the well to flow for a time. Finally, the operator kills the well, closes the valves, removes the packers and trips the tools out of the hole. Depending on the requirements and goals for the test, it may be of short (one hour or less) or long (several days or weeks) duration and there might be more than one flow period and pressure buildup period.",drillstem test
Well Testing,"Well tests conducted with the drillstring still in the hole. Often referred to as DST, these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve. One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the annulus between the drillstring and the casing, thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. With low-permeability formations, or where the production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottomhole valve is opened. These tests are called closed-chamber tests. Drillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased prior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, so obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. Also, pressure is at its highest point, and the reservoir fluids may contain hydrogen sulfide, so these tests can carry considerable risk for rig personnel. The most common test sequence consists of a short flow period, perhaps five or ten minutes, followed by a buildup period of about an hour that is used to determine initial reservoir pressure. This is followed by a flow period of 4 to 24 hours to establish stable flow to the surface, if possible, and followed by the final shut-in or buildup test that is used to determine permeability thickness and flow potential.",drillstem test

Production Facilities,"To remove water from a substance. The substance may be crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids (NGL). Fluid dehydration is needed to prevent corrosion and free-water accumulation in the low points of a pipeline. In the case of gas, it is especially important to avoid hydrate formation and also to meet pipeline requirements. Typical maximum allowable water vapor content is 7 pounds of water per million standard cubic feet. In colder climates, this threshold value could be 3 to 5 pounds per million standard cubic feet. Water vapor can also affect the sweetening and refining processes of a natural gas.

Formation Evaluation,"A feature on a sonic log caused by low signal amplitude that results in erroneously long traveltimes. Sonic logs that do not record waveforms measure the acoustic traveltime between transmitter and receiver by detecting the first signal at the receiver above a certain threshold (first motion detection). The threshold is small so that the signal is detected just after it crosses the zero signal baseline. However, if the threshold is set too high, or the signal is too small, the system will not trigger at the sharp zero crossing but at some later point on the waveform. This increases the apparent transmitter-receiver time. Delta-t stretch is more likely at the far receiver, where signals are weaker, so that the apparent traveltime calculated between receivers is too large. In the extreme case, the system triggers on the next cycle of the waveform, known as cycle skipping.",delta t stretch

Production Facilities,"A device that removes water and water vapor from a gas stream using two or more beds of solid desiccants, such as silica gel or calcium chloride [CaCl2]. Wet gas is passed through the solid material, which absorbs the water, and then dry gas is collected at the top of the device.

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Heavy Oil,A type of in situ combustion in which the burning front moves in the same direction as the injected air. As air is continuously supplied at the injection well, the fire ignited at this location moves toward the production wells. During forward combustion, the temperature behind the burning front is high, indicating a great amount of heat stored in the formation matrix. The injected gas heats on contact with the matrix and recovers only a small amount of the heat, with considerable losses to the surrounding formations. Another drawback of dry forward combustion is the presence of a highly viscous oil zone surrounding the production well. The fluid in this zone remains at the original reservoir temperature and its forward displacement by the heated oil is normally difficult.",dry forward combustion
Well Workover and Intervention,"A device installed on a mixing or pumping system manifold to measure the density of fluids.

Drilling,"A wellbore that has not encountered hydrocarbons in economically producible quantities. Most wells contain salt water in some zones. In addition, the wellbore usually encounters small amounts of crude oil and natural gas.

Drilling,"A condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore. Differential sticking typically occurs when high-contact forces caused by low reservoir pressures, high wellbore pressures, or both, are exerted over a sufficiently large area of the drillstring. Differential sticking is, for most drilling organizations, the greatest drilling problem worldwide in terms of time and financial cost. It is important to note that the sticking force is a product of the differential pressure between the wellbore and the reservoir and the area that the differential pressure is acting upon. This means that a relatively low differential pressure (delta p) applied over a large working area can be just as effective in sticking the pipe as can a high differential pressure applied over a small area.",differential pressure sticking
Drilling Fluids,"A situation in which the drilling assembly (pipe, drill collars and bottomhole assembly) is stuck in filter cake that was previously deposited on a permeable zone. The pipe is held in the cake by a difference in pressures between the hydrostatic pressure of the mud and the pore pressure in the permeable zone. The force required to pull the pipe free can exceed the strength of the pipe. Methods used to get the pipe free, in addition to pulling and torquing the pipe, include: (1) lowering hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore, (2) placing a spotting fluid next to the stuck zone and (3) applying shock force just above the stuck point by mechanical jarring, or (4) all the above. The most common approach, however, to getting free is to place a spot of oil, oil-base mud, or special spotting fluid.",differential pressure sticking

Geology,"An influx of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water down a slope into a larger body of water; the suspended sediment causes the current to have a higher density than the clearer water into which it flows, hence the name. Such currents can occur in lakes and oceans, in some cases as by-products of earthquakes or mass movements such as slumps.

Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the bulk density of the formation, based on the reduction in gamma ray flux between a source and a detector due to Compton scattering. The gamma ray source, usually 137Cs (cesium), is chosen so that gamma ray energies are high enough to interact by Compton scattering but not by pair production. The detectors discriminate against low gamma ray energies that may have been influenced by photoelectric absorption. Although Compton scattering depends on electron density and not bulk density, density logs are calibrated to give the correct bulk density in the majority of sedimentary rocks. Due to the Z/A effect there are small differences in some formations. The measurement responds to the average density of the material between source and detector. In the wireline measurement, care is taken to minimize the mud between the sensors and the formation by pressing a pad against the borehole wall, with source and detector focused into the formation. In the logging-while-drilling measurement, a sleeve may be mounted on the collar around the sensors to exclude the mud. The detectors measure the gamma rays scattered from the formation. Even then, mudcake or borehole rugosity can affect the measurement. It is common practice to compensate for the mudcake by using two or more detectors at different spacings.",density measurement
Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the bulk density of the formation based on borehole-gravity measurements. As the gravitational attraction between two bodies is dependent upon their masses and their separation, it follows that its measurement also can be used to make a direct determination of density. The density thus measured is highly accurate but averaged over a large volume.",density measurement
Formation Evaluation,"A technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging that is based on the difference between the T2 distributions, or spectra, acquired at different polarization times. The technique often is used to detect gas or light oil. These fluids have long T1 that exceed 1 s. A measurement made with a long polarization time will polarize much of these fluids and give significant signal at the appropriate T2. A measurement made with a short polarization time will polarize little of these fluids and will give a much smaller signal. Other fluids, with shorter T1, will be polarized in both cases, so that a difference in signal at the appropriate T2 identifies gas or light oil.",differential spectrum

Geophysics,"The splitting of an incident wave into two waves of different velocities and orthogonal polarizations. Double refraction, or birefringence, occurs in optical mineralogy (see petrography) when plane-polarized light passes through an anisotropic mineral and emerges as two rays traveling at different speeds, the difference between which is characteristic of a mineral. In seismology, incident S-waves can exhibit birefringence as they split into a quasi-shear and a pure-shear wave. Although birefringence was first described by Danish physician Erasmus Bartholin (1625 to 1698) in crystals in 1669, the phenomenon was not fully understood until French physicist Etienne-Louis Malus (1775 to 1812) described polarized light in 1808.",double refraction

Well Testing,"Well tests conducted with the drillstring still in the hole. Often referred to as DST, these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve. One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the annulus between the drillstring and the casing, thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. With low-permeability formations, or where the production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottomhole valve is opened. These tests are called closed-chamber tests. Drillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased prior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, so obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. Also, pressure is at its highest point, and the reservoir fluids may contain hydrogen sulfide, so these tests can carry considerable risk for rig personnel. The most common test sequence consists of a short flow period, perhaps five or ten minutes, followed by a buildup period of about an hour that is used to determine initial reservoir pressure. This is followed by a flow period of 4 to 24 hours to establish stable flow to the surface, if possible, and followed by the final shut-in or buildup test that is used to determine permeability thickness and flow potential",DST
Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, the loss of synchronization of hydrogen atoms precessing at different speeds about the static magnetic field. When the signals from individual atoms are not synchronized, they are out of phase and the total signal is reduced.

Well Testing,"The characteristic plot of pressure versus time obtained from the mechanical recording of pressure gauges in a DST tool. Pressure rises as the tool is lowered into the hole and the hydrostatic head above the tool increases. The pressure stabilizes when the tool reaches bottom and then moves when the packer is set. Pressure drops immediately upon opening of the downhole valve to match the pressure in the drillstring, and then rises as fluid flows into the string. When the downhole valve is closed, the pressure buildup period begins immediately and continues until the valve is closed again.",DST pressure chart

Well Testing,"A wellbore with simultaneous production of hydrocarbons, water or both from more than one producing zone.

Geophysics,"Also known as Kirchhoff migration, a method of seismic migration that uses the integral form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. All methods of seismic migration involve the backpropagation (or continuation) of the seismic wavefield from the region where it was measured (Earth's surface or along a borehole) into the region to be imaged. In Kirchhoff migration, this is done by using the Kirchhoff integral representation of a field at a given point as a (weighted) superposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and times. Continuation of the wavefield requires a background model of seismic velocity, which is usually a model of constant or smoothly varying velocity. Because of the integral form of Kirchhoff migration, its implementation reduces to stacking the data along curves that trace the arrival time of energy scattered by image points in the earth.",diffraction stack

Formation Evaluation,"A model of shaly formations that considers there to be two waters in the pore space: far water, which is the normal formation water; and near water (or clay-bound water) in the electrical double layer near the clay surface. The clay-bound water consists of clay counter-ions and the associated water of hydration. The volume of this layer is determined by its thickness, which is constant at high salinities, and its area, which is proportional to the counter-ion concentration per unit pore volume (Qv). The volume of clay-bound water per unit pore volume, Swb, can therefore be written as: Swb = alpha * vq * Qv where vq = 0.28 cm3/meq at 25oC is the factor relating volume to counter-ion concentration at high salinity and is a function only of temperature, and alpha = 1 above a certain salinity, below which it increases with temperature and with decreasing salinity. The fractional volume of the far water is then (1 ? alpha?* vq * Qv). The dual-water concept was developed for the interpretation of resistivity in shaly sands, but is also useful in the interpretation of nuclear and nuclear magnetic resonance logs. In these cases, the parameter most used is the total volume of clay-bound water in the rock, equal to Swb multiplied by the total porosity.",dual water

P-waves incident on an interface at other than normal incidence can produce reflected and transmitted S-waves, in that case known as converted waves.",dilatational wave
Geophysics,"A technique used to estimate the value of a potential field or seismic data at a surface beneath a measured surface. The method is risky because it assumes continuity of the field, so anomalies affect predictions, especially if they occur beneath the measured surface. Noise can be exaggerated and affect calculations adversely.",downward continuation
Formation Evaluation,"Referring to a borehole-compensation scheme for sonic logs that combines measurements taken when the logging tool is at two different depths in the borehole. In normal borehole-compensation schemes, the effects of caves and sonde tilt are minimized by combining measurements from a second transmitter (T2) above a pair of receivers with those from the first transmitter (T1) below the receivers. This arrangement makes the logging tool unacceptably long for the long-spacing sonic log. In the depth-derived system, T2 is located below T1, at a distance equal to the receiver spacing. T1 is fired and the transit time between the receivers at depth z (TT1z) is recorded as usual. Then when T1 and T2 are at depth z, both are fired sequentially and the difference in time for their signals to reach one of the receivers is recorded (TT2z). The average of TT1z and TT2z is borehole-compensated since the acoustic signals traveled in opposite directions for the two measurements.",depth derived
Heavy Oil,A hydrocarbon fluid that is used to dilute heavy oil and reduce its viscosity for easier transportation.

Formation Evaluation,"A magnetic mark placed on a logging cable as a reference for depth measurements. The marks are placed on the cable at regular intervals, usually 100 ft [30 m] or 50 m [164 ft], under a certain tension in a workshop. The intervals may change slightly as a function of tension downhole, but this change can be corrected for. During logging operations, the marks are detected by a magnetic mark detector, and then used to check and correct the depth read by the depth wheel.",depth mark
Drilling Fluids,"Also called make-up water, which is water added to maintain or dilute a water-mud system. The added water may be fresh water, seawater or salt water, as appropriate for the mud. Make-up water volume is an important parameter in a material balance check on solids content and solids removal efficiency for a mud system. The amount of dilution strongly influences mud economics. If soft make-up water is needed, treatments to remove hardness ions should be done prior to adding the water to the mud to avoid clay flocculation and polymer precipitation.",dilution water

Drilling Fluids,"Equipment used to measure filtration under dynamic conditions. Two commercial dynamic-filtration testers are available, one of which uses a thick-walled cylinder with rock-like characteristics as the filter medium to simulate radial flow into a wellbore. The other tester uses flat porous disks, such as paper or fused ceramic plates, as filter media. In a dynamic test, filter cake is continually eroded and deposited. Data from this test include a steady-state filtration rate measured during the test, and cake thickness, cake quality and return permeability of the filter medium measured at the conclusion of a test. There is no API standardized test equipment or procedure.",dynamic filter press
Formation Evaluation,"Pertaining to two or more logging curves that have been aligned in depth. Logs recorded on different runs will not be exactly aligned at all depths because of the difficulty of perfect depth control. If the two logs are offset by the same amount throughout the log, then only a simple depth shift is required. If the offset varies, then the logs need to be depth matched. Depth matching is simplest if both runs contain the same type of log, such as a gamma ray. The two gamma rays can then be aligned, either manually or with software, and the other logs shifted by the same amount. Otherwise the alignment is based on two logs that respond in a similar fashion, such as a neutron porosity and a shallow laterolog. Depth matching also may be needed for logs recorded on the same run. Although there is a fixed distance between the measure points and the depth reference, the apparent distance will vary if the tool moves unevenly up the hole, due to stick and slip or yo-yo effects. Depth matching is then necessary.",depth matched
Geophysics,"A type of local seismic event that, in contrast to a bright spot, shows weak rather than strong amplitude. The weak amplitude might correlate with hydrocarbons that reduce the contrast in acoustic impedance between the reservoir and the overlying rock, or might be related to a stratigraphic change that reduces acoustic impedance.",dim spot
Drilling Fluids,"A filtration process in which the slurry being filtered is being circulated over the filter cake, so that the cake is simultaneously eroded and deposited. The erosion rate depends on the shear rate of the fluid at the face of the cake. If the shear rate remains constant, cake thickness and filtration rate reach steady state, usually in a matter of hours. When the conditions change, a new steady state will be established.",dynamic filtration
Reservoir Characterization,"The practice of shifting depths of various data sets to a measurement that is known to be on depth. The general standard that is usually used is the first resistivity logs run, because those logs usually underwent the most rigorous depth control. Depth matching is usually applied to all wireline data, cores, borehole seismic data, and any other data taken in a well. Depth matching is a vital process in any well evaluation or any reservoir characterization exercise, so much so that, in its absence, accuracy and validity of the exercise must be questioned.",depth matching

Reservoir Characterization,"The angle between a planar feature, such as a sedimentary bed or a fault, and a horizontal plane. True dip is the angle a plane makes with a horizontal plane, the angle being measured in a direction perpendicular to the strike of the plane.

Given the apparent dip and the strike, or two apparent dips, the true dip can be computed.",dip

This requires an accurate knowledge of vertical and horizontal seismic velocity variations.",depth migration
Formation Evaluation,"An algorithm for correcting the effects of dip or borehole deviation on the response of a logging measurement. These effects are significant for deep-reading logs such as induction and electrode devices. The standard processing used to produce these logs assumes a vertical well with horizontal formation layers. In the presence of a relative dip between the borehole and formation layers, the logs may read incorrectly. For older logs such as the dual induction, a set of inverse filters can be designed to correct for dip effect up to about 60. For modern array logs, iterative forward modeling with a one-dimensional layered earth model can correct up to about 85.",dip correction

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A dynamic fluid-mixing process in which an injected gas exchanges components with in situ oil until the phases achieve a state of miscibility within the mixing zone of the flood front. In a vaporizing drive, light and intermediate components from the oil phase enter the gas phase. By contrast, in a condensing drive, intermediate components from the gas phase enter the oil phase. The process may be a combination of vaporizing and condensing drives.",dynamic miscibility
Formation Evaluation,"The distance from the borehole wall that the mud filtrate has penetrated into the formation. The depth of invasion affects whether a log measures the invaded zone, the undisturbed zone or part of each zone. The term is closely related to the diameter of invasion, the latter being twice the depth of invasion plus the borehole diameter. Depth of invasion is a more appropriate parameter for describing the response of pad and azimuthally focused measurements such as density and microresistivity logs. The term is well-defined in the case of a step profile of invasion. In the case of an annulus or a transition zone, two depths must be defined, corresponding to the inner and outer limits of the annulus or transition zone. When the invasion model is not specified, the term usually refers to the outer limit of invasion.",depth of invasion
Reservoir Characterization,A fault whose primary movement is in the dip direction. Dip faults are also referred to as dip-slip faults.,dip fault
Formation Evaluation," Enhanced Oil Recovery,The process of forcing a nonwetting phase into a porous rock. Oil migrates into most reservoirs as the non-wetting phase, so initial charging of the reservoir is a drainage process.",drainage
Drilling,"The stationing of a vessel, especially a drillship or semisubmersible drilling rig, at a specific location in the sea by the use of computer-controlled propulsion units called thrusters. Though drilling vessels have varying sea and weather state design conditions, most remain relatively stable even under high wind, wave and current loading conditions. Inability to maintain stationkeeping, whether due to excessive natural forces or failure of one or more electromechanical systems, leads to a drive off condition that requires emergency procedures to disconnect the riser from the subsea BOP stack, or worse, drop the riser from the vessel altogether.",dynamic positioning
Formation Evaluation,"A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the face of the tool or the borehole wall. The depth of investigation summarizes the radial response of the measurement in one or more directions. For nuclear and resistivity measurements, the depth of investigation should be associated with the percentage of signal received from within that depth, typically either 50% or 90%. Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content. The depths of investigation can vary considerably in inhomogeneous conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. They should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response. For other measurements, the depth of investigation is either well-defined by the tool physics (in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance), or else can be given only approximately, an accurate value being too dependent on formation properties (in the case of acoustic and electromagnetic propagation). The term is used for all measurements but is most appropriate for azimuthally focused devices such as nuclear logs. For azimuthally symmetric devices such as resistivity logs, the term radius of investigation is more appropriate.",depth of investigation

In a reservoir drained by multiple wells, the volume ultimately drained by any given well is proportional to that well's production rate: Vi = Vt x qi/qt, where Vi is the drainage volume of Well i, Vt is the entire drainage volume of the reservoir, qi is the production rate from Well i, and qt is the total production rate from the reservoir.",drainage volume
Formation Evaluation,"The point in a well from which depth is measured. Alternatively, the depth reference is the point at which the depth is defined as being zero. It is typically the top of the kelly bushing or the level of the drill floor on the rig that is used to drill the well. The depth measured from that point is the measured depth (MD) for the well. Even when the drilling rig has been removed, all subsequent measurements and operations in the well are still tied in to the same depth reference. However, for multiwell studies, the depths are normally shifted to the permanent datum. The depth reference and its elevation above the permanent datum are recorded on the log heading. In some contexts, the term may refer to any point from which depth is measured.",depth reference
Geophysics,A pair of opposite (and equal) electrical charges. The strength of the dipole is a vector quantity whose direction points from the positive to the negative charge and whose magnitude is the product of the absolute value of the charge times the separation.

Formation Evaluation,"A calibrated wheel used to drive the depth recording system in wireline logging. The wheel is pressed against the logging cable as the cable is spooled onto the drum and therefore turns as the cable is run in and out of the borehole. After zeroing the depth on surface, the depth wheel provides the depth input to the recording system. Small errors in calibration and slippage can cause the wheel to introduce systematic errors in the depth recorded. For this reason, the depth is checked and corrected using depth marks. The depth wheel is also referred to as a depth encoder. Modern encoders have two wheels so that slippage can be detected by differences between the two measurements.",depth wheel

Production Logging,"A small sensor in a production logging tool that distinguishes between hydrocarbon and water in its vicinity as it is moved up and down a production well. The electric probe was the first type of local probe to be introduced, appearing initially in the early 1990s. Electric probes measure the local and average holdup of water and give an image of the flow structure across the well. Most electric probes emit a high-frequency current and measure the amplitude of the signal, and hence the impedance, of the fluid in a small sphere near the probe. The output is designed to be digital, indicating conductance when the probe is in front of water, and no conductance when it is in front of hydrocarbon. The water must have a certain minimum salinity, below which the device will not work.",electric probe

Geology,"The sudden release of accumulated stress in the Earth by movement or shaking. Earthquakes are caused by tectonic activity, volcanoes and human activity (such as explosions). Earthquakes occur in the outer 720 km [445 miles] of the Earth, where rocks tend to break rather than flow under stress. The magnitude of earthquakes is determined according to the logarithmic Richter scale. An earthquake of magnitude 4.5 can cause damage, although humans can feel earthquakes as weak as magnitude 2.0. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 measured 8.25 on the Richter scale, and the largest ever recorded were 8.9 magnitude earthquakes in Colombia and Ecuador (1906) and Japan (1933), and 9.5 in Chile (1960).",earthquake
Formation Evaluation,"A difference in vertical and horizontal resistivity within a formation and at the scale of the resistivity measurement.

Formation Evaluation,"A technique in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging based on a long echo spacing, specially chosen to enhance the diffusion of formation water. Echo spacings in standard NMR logs are too short to allow any significant diffusion relaxation from water. Long echo spacings, for example 3 s, cause diffusion relaxation to limit the maximum T2 from water. They also limit the maximum T2 from light hydrocarbons.

Once ranked as a third stage of oil recovery that was carried out after secondary recovery, the techniques employed during enhanced oil recovery can actually be initiated at any time during the productive life of an oil reservoir. Its purpose is not only to restore formation pressure, but also to improve oil displacement or fluid flow in the reservoir. The three major types of enhanced oil recovery operations are chemical flooding (alkaline flooding or micellar-polymer flooding), miscible displacement (carbon dioxide [CO2] injection or hydrocarbon injection), and thermal recovery (steamflood or in-situ combustion). The optimal application of each type depends on reservoir temperature, pressure, depth, net pay, permeability, residual oil and water saturations, porosity and fluid properties such as oil API gravity and viscosity.

Drilling,"Off-center, as when a pipe is off-center within another pipe or the openhole. Eccentricity is usually expressed as a percentage. A pipe would be considered to be fully (100%) eccentric if it were lying against the inside diameter of the enclosing pipe or hole.

Formation Evaluation,"The adjustments that must be made to log measurements to bring them back to the standard conditions for which the tool has been characterized. Different measurements require different corrections. For example resistivity measurements usually require correction for the borehole, invasion and shoulder beds, and may also be corrected for apparent dip, anisotropy and surrounding beds in horizontal wells. Density measurements require correction only for borehole size, while neutron porosity measurements require corrections for temperature, pressure and a large number of borehole and formation parameters. Not all corrections are significant in all cases. Corrections can be calculated manually, using charts, or applied through software. Conventionally, corrections are applied sequentially, as for example first borehole then invasion. In some situations, such as the combination of deep invasion and high apparent dip on a resistivity measurement, the corrections are too interdependent for sequential application to be accurate. The solution is iterative forward modeling.",environmental corrections

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"An instrument used in a corrosion testing to determine metal loss. The probe directly measures the increase in resistance of a metal as its cross-sectional area is reduced by corrosion.

Geology,"A class of sedimentary minerals and sedimentary rocks that form by precipitation from evaporating aqueous fluid. Common evaporite minerals are halite, gypsum and anhydrite, which can form as seawater evaporates, and the rocks limestone and dolostone. Certain evaporite minerals, particularly halite, can form excellent cap rocks or seals for hydrocarbon traps because they have minimal porosity and they tend to deform plastically (as opposed to brittle fracturing that would facilitate leakage).",evaporite

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Abbreviation for enhanced oil recovery, an oil recovery enhancement method using sophisticated techniques that alter the original properties of oil. Once ranked as a third stage of oil recovery that was carried out after secondary recovery, the techniques employed during enhanced oil recovery can actually be initiated at any time during the productive life of an oil reservoir. Its purpose is not only to restore formation pressure, but also to improve oil displacement or fluid flow in the reservoir. The three major types of enhanced oil recovery operations are chemical flooding (alkaline flooding or micellar-polymer flooding), miscible displacement (carbon dioxide [CO2] injection or hydrocarbon injection), and thermal recovery (steamflood or in-situ combustion). The optimal application of each type depends on reservoir temperature, pressure, depth, net pay, permeability, residual oil and water saturations, porosity and fluid properties such as oil API gravity and viscosity. Enhanced oil recovery is also known as improved oil recovery or tertiary recovery.",EOR

Drilling Fluids,"A test for oil-base and synthetic-base muds that indicates the emulsion and oil-wetting qualities of the sample. The test is performed by inserting the ES probe into a cup of 120°F [48.9°C] mud and pushing a test button. The ES meter automatically applies an increasing voltage (from 0 to 2000 volts) across an electrode gap in the probe. Maximum voltage that the mud will sustain across the gap before conducting current is displayed as the ES voltage. The modern ES meter has sine-wave circuitry, whereas older meters used square-wave circuits. (The older units should not be used because they do not correctly address the theory described in the reference below.) The ES sine-wave design and meaning of ES readings have been studied and were found to relate to an oil mud's oil-wetting of solids and to stability of the emulsion droplets in a complex fashion not yet understood.

Drilling,"The work shift of a drilling crew that starts in the evening or late afternoon. Drilling operations usually occur around the clock because of the cost to rent a rig. As a result, there are usually two separate crews working twelve-hour tours to keep the operation going. Some companies prefer three eight-hour tours: the evening tour starts at 4 PM; the graveyard tour is the overnight shift or the shift that begins at midnight. (Pronounced tower in many areas.)",evening tour
Production Logging,"A technique for measuring the effect of pits and holes in the inner wall of a casing on a high-frequency electrical signal induced in the casing. The eddy-current measurement is used in conjunction with a flux-leakage measurement to determine casing corrosion, the latter being sensitive to the defects on both the inner and outer walls. The principle of measurement is similar to the openhole induction log, but at higher frequencies. A transmitter coil produces a magnetic field that induces eddy currents in the casing wall. These currents generate their own magnetic field that induces a signal in two closely spaced receiver coils. In smooth casing, these signals are the same, but if the inner wall is pitted, the signals are different. Transmitter-receiver combinations are placed on multiple pads applied against the casing at several azimuths to fully cover the casing wall.",eddy current measurement

Formation Evaluation,"That part of the effect of gas on the neutron porosity measurement that is not explained by differences in hydrogen index. By using the concept of hydrogen index, the only significant contributor to the neutron porosity in a gas zone is the liquid-filled porosity, since the hydrogen indices of gas and matrix are close to zero. However, the resultant liquid-filled porosity is found to be too low. The error comes from treating the gas-filled porosity as matrix. If this matrix is excavated and replaced with gas, the correct response can be predicted.",excavation effect

Formation Evaluation,"The resistivity measured by an electrode device. The term often is used to distinguish this resistivity from that measured by the measurements-while-drilling propagation resistivity, or the wireline induction resistivity. The term may also refer to measurements-while-drilling toroid devices, such as bit resistivity, ring resistivity and button resistivity. These devices do not use electrodes but have a similar response. Electrode resistivity measurements respond to resistivity, not conductivity. They are therefore best at measuring true formation resistivity at high resistivities, high contrasts in resistivity between formation and drilling mud, and for conductive invasion. These are conditions that are not well covered by propagation and induction resistivity.",electrode resistivity
Formation Evaluation,"A measurement based on the slowing down of neutrons between a source and one or more detectors that measure neutrons at the epithermal level, where their energy is above that of the surrounding matter, between approximately 0.4 and 10 eV. The slowing-down process is dominated by hydrogen, and is characterized by a slowing-down length. By measuring the neutrons at the epithermal level, rather than the thermal level, the response is a purer estimate of hydrogen index, unaffected by thermal absorbers. On the other hand, the count rate is smaller for the same source and source-detector spacing. Epithermal measurements have been made with both the compensated neutron technique and by using a pad pressed against the borehole wall with detectors focused into the formation.",epithermal neutron porosity measurement
Well Workover and Intervention,"The cement slurry remaining in the wellbore following a cement squeeze in which the objective is to squeeze slurry into the perforations and behind the casing or liner. The volume of slurry required to effect a successful squeeze is often difficult to estimate.

Removal of the excess cement slurry before it sets has been a key objective in the development of modern cement-squeeze techniques.",excess cement

Drilling Fluids,"Abbreviation for equivalents-per-million. This unit of concentration is determined by dividing the number of equivalents of a substance by the weight of the solution that contains the substance, expressing the result as parts per million, and then dividing by the valency.

By dividing the ppm by the valency of calcium, which is 2 in this case, the result is the epm of calcium, 0.5 epm.",epm
Drilling,"The speed the drilling fluid attains when accelerated through bit nozzles. The exit velocity is typically in the low-hundreds of feet per second. It has been reported that in certain shaly formations, an impingement velocity on the order of 250 feet per second is required to effectively remove newly created rock chips from the bottom of the hole. This impingement velocity is not, however, the same as the exit velocity, since the high-energy fluid jet loses velocity through viscous losses and conversions from kinetic energy to forms of potential energy occur once the fluid leaves the bit. For this reason, the well designer generally seeks to maximize the fluid velocity (or other measure of jet energy) to achieve maximum cleaning at the bottom of the hole.",exit velocity

Reservoir Characterization,"A method for determining the effective properties of random fields, commonly abbreviated EMT. Originally developed to estimate transport coefficients, this theory is based on the idea of replacing the inhomogeneous medium by an equivalent homogenous medium such that the fluctuations induced by restoring the heterogeneity average to zero. EMT is used to upscale parameters such as permeability for use in coarse-grained reservoir simulation studies. This use is controversial in reservoirs that are not homogeneous.

Formation Evaluation,"The electromagnetic force, in millivolts, generated by an electrolyte flowing through a permeable medium. This potential is an unwanted contribution to the spontaneous potential (SP) log. In principle, there is no flow into a permeable reservoir at the time of logging, since the mudcake has isolated the reservoir from the borehole. However, it is possible for mudcakes and shales to produce an electrokinetic potential at the time of logging. In normal conditions, any potential is small and equal along the borehole, so that the effect on the SP is negligible. A significant electrokinetic potential can be generated in particular conditions, for example, high differential pressure or poor mudcakes.",electrokinetic potential

Production Logging,"An in-situ measurement of the inside diameter of a casing or tubing using an electromagnetic technique. As with the electromagnetic thickness measurement, and usually measured at the same time, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. At high frequency, the signal penetrates less than a tenth of a millimeter into the casing, and the phase shift can be related to the casing internal diameter. Unlike a mechanical or ultrasonic caliper, the measurement does not respond to nonmagnetic scale. For the purpose of determining the true internal diameter, this is a disadvantage, but for the purpose of determining corrosion, it is an advantage.",electromagnetic caliper
Well Completions,"A device that is operated to equalize the pressure across a valve, plug or similar pressure or fluid isolation barrier. The operating mechanism on many pressure-sealing devices is rendered inoperable once the mechanism has been activated by pressure. In such cases, the pressure across the pressure barrier must be equalized before the barrier can be removed.",equalizing valve
Well Workover and Intervention,"A high-pressure valve, generally of small diameter, located on a conduit that runs between the two sides of an isolation valve or blowout preventer ram set. The forces acting on isolation devices such as blowout preventer rams can be extremely high, preventing the rams from being opened, or causing damage to the ram set seals during the opening process. The equalizing valve allows the pressure to be equalized across the ram set or isolation valve, enabling the device to be opened safely.",equalizing valve
Well Completions,A device or completion component designed to enable relative movement between two fixed assemblies in the event of thermal expansion or contraction.

Geology,The interconnected pore volume or void space in a rock that contributes to fluid flow or permeability in a reservoir. Effective porosity excludes isolated pores and pore volume occupied by water adsorbed on clay minerals or other grains. Total porosity is the total void space in the rock whether or not it contributes to fluid flow. Effective porosity is typically less than total porosity.,effective porosity
Formation Evaluation,"In the original definition of core analysts, the volume of connected pores in a unit volume of rock. Effective porosity in this sense is the total porosity less the isolated porosity. It is the porosity measured by most core analysis techniques that do not involve disaggregating the sample. In these techniques, the porosity is usually measured on totally dried core samples. Drying removes most of the clay-bound water. In log interpretation, effective porosity means the total porosity less the clay-bound water. The definition is based on the analysis of shaly formations, in which the clay-bound water is considered immobile and hence ineffective. Isolated porosity is rare in such formations and is ignored, being included in the effective porosity. Effective porosity on dried core samples is therefore greater than effective porosity from log analysis, and close to the total porosity from log analysis. In humidity-dried cores, part of the clay-bound water is not removed, and the difference is reduced. In some usage, the capillary-bound water is not considered part of the effective porosity. In this case effective porosity is synonymous with free fluid. Effective porosity is measured in volume/volume, percent or porosity units, p.u.",effective porosity
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A process to increase thermal energy in a reservoir using electromagnetic means. The two types of electromagnetic heating are conductive and radio frequency (RF). In conductive heating, a current passes from one electrode through the formation to a second electrode. Electrical resistance of the reservoir brine generates thermal energy, heating the reservoir. In RF heating, transmitters in the wellbore generate electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the microwave range that are directed into the formation. The waves interact with water molecules, generating heat in much the same way a microwave oven does. Since both methods rely on water to transfer thermal energy to the reservoir, higher water saturation increases the efficiency of the heat transfer.",electromagnetic heating

Reservoir Characterization,"The results of extrapolating from a known data point to points away from measurements.

Geophysics,"A group of techniques in which natural or artificially generated electric or magnetic fields are measured at the Earth's surface or in boreholes in order to map variations in the Earth's electrical properties (resistivity, permeability or permittivity). Most applications of surface electromagnetic methods today are for mineral and groundwater exploration or for shallow environmental mapping. Electromagnetic or electrical logging is, however, the main technique used in oil exploration to measure the amount of hydrocarbons in the pores of underground reservoirs. Inductive electromagnetic (EM) methods include a variety of low frequency (a few Hz to several kHz) techniques deploying large or small wire coils at or near the surface. In older usage, electromagnetic method tended to refer only to inductive methods. This term is now commonly used for any method employing electromagnetic fields, including methods that use direct current (electrical or resistivity methods) and induced polarization (IP), methods that use microwave frequencies (ground-penetrating radar), and methods that use natural electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric methods).",electromagnetic method

Perforating,"A perforating gun assembly that disintegrates upon firing, thereby reducing the volume and dimensions of retrieved components. Expendable guns are typically used where wellbore restrictions allow only limited access, as in through-tubing applications. The distortion caused to the gun assembly during firing would typically prevent recovery of a conventional gun design through the limited clearances. The expendable gun assembly breaks into small pieces that drop to the bottom of the well, leaving only a relatively small subassembly that is easily recovered to surface.",expendable gun
Production Logging,"In the context of spinner flowmeters, the apparent fluid speed measured by the spinner as the tool is moved up and down the well.

Unless otherwise stated, water saturation is the fraction of formation water in the undisturbed zone. The saturation is known as the total water saturation if the pore space is the total porosity, but is called effective water saturation if the pore space is the effective porosity. If used without qualification, the term water saturation usually refers to the effective water saturation.",effective water saturation
Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the high frequency (about 1 GHz) dielectric properties of the formation. In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array. An ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake. Borehole compensation is used to correct for sonde tilt or a rough borehole wall.",electromagnetic propagation measurement
Formation Evaluation,"With reference to the conductivity of brines, the ionic conductivity provided by a unit ion concentration.

Reservoir Characterization,"A computer system that uses a rule-based algorithm to provide expertise on a given subject. Many computer programs have been written for use in the oil field using rule-based approaches to provide expert systems. The rules are taken from an expert working in the field and are written in a way that attempts to reproduce the knowledge and approaches used by that expert to solve a range of actual problems. Most such programs are limited to specific disciplines such as dipmeter interpretation, electrofacies determination, reservoir characterization, blowout prevention or drilling fluid selection.

Well Testing,"The value of wellbore radius that produces equivalent results to those obtained using a skin factor of zero. It is possible to represent departures from ideal (zero skin) behavior by using the skin effect, or alternatively by changing the value of the effective wellbore radius.

For a negative skin effect, such as often obtained after well stimulation, effective wellbore radius is larger than actual well radius.",effective wellbore radius
Production Logging,"An in-situ measurement of the thickness of a casing or tubing string using an electromagnetic technique. The result is presented as a type of casing-inspection log, giving an estimate of metal loss and detecting corrosion. In the usual method, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. This phase shift depends on the casing-wall thickness and internal diameter, as well as the casing conductivity and magnetic permeability. The effects change at different frequencies, so that by varying the frequency, the thickness and internal diameter can be uniquely determined. Electromagnetic thickness can also be measured using other techniques, for example from a casing-potential profile or a flux-leakage measurement.",electromagnetic thickness

Formation Evaluation,"Referring to a log of the yields of different elements in the formation, as measured by capture gamma ray spectroscopy using a pulsed neutron generator. The log is a type of pulsed neutron spectroscopy log that uses only the capture spectrum. The capture spectrum is formed by many elements, but since the main purpose of the log is to determine lithology, the principal outputs are the relative yields of silicon, calcium, iron, sulfur, titanium and gadolinium. The yields give information only on the relative concentration of these elements. To get absolute elemental concentrations, it is necessary to calibrate to cores, or, more often, use a model such as the oxide-closure model. The depth of investigation of the measurement is several inches into the formation. It can be run in open or cased hole. The absolute elemental concentrations are insensitive to fluids in the borehole and formation.",elemental capture spectroscopy
Formation Evaluation,"The effective resistivity of the formation water or the mud filtrate, as it affects the electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potential is the main source of the spontaneous potential log. The equivalent water resistivity, or equivalent resistivity, is defined as the reciprocal of the activity of a solution, so that the formula for the electrochemical potential, Ec, can be written as: Ec = - K log10 (Rmfe / Rwe) where K is a coefficient, and Rmfe and Rwe are the equivalent water resistivities. The importance of Rmfe and Rwe is that they are equal to the actual water resistivities for NaCl solutions above about 0.1 ohm-m. In salty waters below 0.1ohm-m, the equivalent resistivity is lower by an amount that depends on temperature and salinity. In fresh waters, divalent ions such as Ca++ and Mg++ have a strong effect on Ec. Rwe is then related to Rw by an empirical transform that assumes average concentrations of these ions. For fresh mud filtrates, it has been common practice to set Rmfe = 0.85 * Rmf.",equivalent water resistivity

For example, elastic anisotropy occurs when seismic, or elastic, waves travel through rock at differing velocities in various directions. Elastic anisotropy occurs if there is a preferred alignment of a material’s fabric elements—crystals, grains, cracks, bedding planes, joints or fractures—on a scale smaller than the length of the wave. This alignment causes waves to propagate fastest in its direction.

Drilling,"Abbreviation for extended-reach drilling. Mobil Oil Company first used this term in the early 1980s for drilling directional wells in which the drilled horizontal reach (HR) attained at total depth (TD) exceeded the true vertical depth (TVD) by a factor greater than or equal to two. Extended-reach drilling (ERD) is particularly challenging for directional drilling and requires specialized planning to execute well construction. Since the term was coined, the scope of extended-reach drilling has broadened and the definition, which is now more flexible, includes deep wells with horizontal distance-to-depth, or H:V, ratios less than two. The drilling industry’s ERD database classifies wells, with increasing degree of well construction complexity, into low-, medium-, extended- and very extended-reach wells. Construction complexity depends on many factors, including water depth (for offshore wells), rig capability, geologic constraints and overall TVD. For example, a vertical well with TVD greater than 7,620 m [25,000 ft] is considered an extended-reach well.

Drilling,"Mobil Oil Company first used this term in the early 1980s for drilling directional wells in which the drilled horizontal reach (HR) attained at total depth (TD) exceeded the true vertical depth (TVD) by a factor greater than or equal to two. Extended-reach drilling (ERD) is particularly challenging for directional drilling and requires specialized planning to execute well construction.

Drilling,"The process whereby steel components become less resistant to breakage and generally much weaker in tensile strength. While embrittlement has many causes, in the oil field it is usually the result of exposure to gaseous or liquid hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. On a molecular level, hydrogen ions work their way between the grain boundaries of the steel, where hydrogen ions recombine into molecular hydrogen [H2], taking up more space and weakening the bonds between the grains. The formation of molecular hydrogen can cause sudden metal failure due to cracking when the metal is subjected to tensile stress. This type of hydrogen-induced failure is produced when hydrogen atoms enter high strength steels. The failures due to hydrogen embrittlement normally have a period where no damage is observed, which is called incubation, followed by a sudden catastrophic failure. Hydrogen embrittlement is also called acid brittleness.",embrittlement

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A type of damage in which there is a combination of two or more immiscible fluids, including gas, that will not separate into individual components. Emulsions can form when fluid filtrates or injected fluids and reservoir fluids (for example oil or brine) mix, or when the pH of the producing fluid changes, such as after an acidizing treatment. Acidizing might change the pH from 6 or 7 to less than 4. Emulsions are normally found in gravel packs and perforations, or inside the formation. Most emulsions break easily when the source of the mixing energy is removed. However, some natural and artificial stabilizing agents, such as surfactants and small particle solids, keep fluids emulsified. Natural surfactants, created by bacteria or during the oil generation process, can be found in many waters and crude oils, while artificial surfactants are part of many drilling, completion or stimulation fluids. Among the most common solids that stabilize emulsions are iron sulfide, paraffin, sand, silt, clay, asphalt, scale and corrosion products. Emulsions are typically treated using mutual solvents.",emulsion
Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A dispersion of droplets of one liquid in another liquid with which it is incompletely miscible. Emulsions can form in heavy oils that contain a significant amount of asphaltenes. The asphaltenes act as surfactants with treatment or formation water. The resulting emulsion droplets have high-energy bonds creating a very tight dispersion of droplets that is not easily separated. These surface-acting forces can create both oil-in-water and/or water-in-oil emulsions. Such emulsions require temperature and chemical treating in surface equipment in order to separate.",emulsion

Maximum voltage that the mud will sustain across the gap before conducting current is displayed as the ES voltage. The modern ES meter has sine-wave circuitry, whereas older meters used square-wave circuits. (The older units should not be used because they do not correctly address the theory described in the reference below.)

The disturbance field, which is associated with diurnal field variations and magnetic storms, is affected by solar activity (solar wind), the interplanetary magnetic field and the Earth’s magnetic field. The external magnetic field exhibits variations on several time scales, which may affect the applicability of magnetic reference models. Very long-period variations are related to the solar cycle of about 11 years. Short-term variations result from daily changes in solar radiation, atmospheric tides and conductivity.

Drilling Fluids,"In drilling fluid parlance, the absorption of a polymer film onto cuttings and wellbore walls to form a coat or barrier. The term is usually applied to shale encapsulation by long-chain, acrylamide-acrylate (PHPA) polymers. Negative sites on PHPA may bond to positive sites on the clays in shales, although it is not well-defined how (or how well) encapsulation works.

Production Logging,"A recording of the in-situ rate of fluid flow at different depths in a well, normally one completed for production or injection. The flow profile is a log recorded in a unit such as barrels per day, or as a percentage of the total flow from the reservoir in a production well or into the reservoir in an injection well. In single-phase flow, the profile can be determined from a flowmeter.

Reservoir Characterization,"The characteristics of a rock unit that reflect its origin and permit its differentiation from other rock units around it. Facies usually are characterized using all the geological characteristics known for that rock unit. In reservoir characterization and reservoir simulation, the facies properties that are most important are the petrophysical characteristics that control the fluid behavior in the facies. Electrofacies and other multivariate techniques are often used to determine these characteristics. Rock types rather than facies are more likely to be used in reservoir simulation.",facies
Well Completions,"The movement of fine clay, quartz particles or similar materials within the reservoir formation due to drag forces during production. Fines migration may result from an unconsolidated or inherently unstable formation, or from use of an incompatible treatment fluid that liberates fine particles. Unlike sand migration that is best stabilized, the material mobilized in fines migration should be produced to avoid near-wellbore damage. Fines migration causes particles suspended in the produced fluid to bridge the pore throats near the wellbore, reducing well productivity. Fines can include different materials such as clays (phyllosilicates smaller than 4 microns) and silts (silicates or aluminosilicates with sizes ranging from 4 to 64 microns). Kaolinite and illite are the most common migrating clays. Damage created by fines usually is located within a radius of 3 to 5 ft [1 to 2 m] of the wellbore, but can also occur in gravel-pack completions. In sandstone formations, hydrofluoric acid [HF] mixtures are used to dissolve fines. In carbonate formations, the goal is not to dissolve but rather to disperse fines in the wormholes, so hydrochloric [HCl] acid is used as the treatment fluid.",fines migration
Well Testing,"The predominant flow geometry reflected in a pressure-transient response that is most easily recognized in the log-log presentation of the pressure-change derivative. The most easily recognized flow regime is radial flow, which produces a constant or flat derivative. Spherical flow, which may result from a limited-entry completion, has a characteristic -1/2 slope in the derivative. Wellbore storage starts as a unit slope in pressure change and then the derivative bends over in a characteristic hump shape. Linear flow produced by flow to a fracture or a long horizontal well has a derivative slope of +1/2. Bilinear flow results when the fracture has finite conductivity and has a derivative slope of +1/4.",flow regime
Production Logging,"A description of the geometrical distribution of a multiphase fluid moving through a pipe. Many different terms are used to describe this distribution, the distinction between each one being qualitative and somewhat arbitrary.

For oil-water mixtures, the most common regimes are bubble flow, slug flow and emulsion flow. In horizontal wells, there may be stratified or wavy stratified flow in addition to many of the regimes observed in vertical wells. Two-phase flow regimes have often been presented as plots, or maps, with the phase velocities or functions of them on each axis. Earlier maps were named after their authors, for example Griffith-Wallis, Duns-Ros and Taitel-Dukler.",flow regime
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A laboratory test to determine the phase envelope between lean gas and oil by equilibrating a gas sample several times with fresh samples of oil. In a forward-contact test, light and intermediate components are stripped from the oil by multiple contacts with the gas.

The molar ratios at each contact step are typically designed using PVT simulation software that incorporates the fluid composition at each contact.",forward multiple contact test
Reservoir Characterization,"The act of modeling a reservoir using knowledge of the facies that make up the reservoir and the depositional environments that the facies represent.

This is the case in a single pore, because the surface relaxation is not strong enough for observation of separate T2 peaks, for example, for water near the surface of a grain and water in the middle of the pore. Fast diffusion is also considered to occur between most clay- and capillary-bound water, between normal pores and micropores within some carbonates, and in some other systems.",fast diffusion

In hard formations, several normal modes are excited in addition to the Stoneley and leaky modes.",fast formation
Formation Evaluation,"The depth of the first reliable reading of a curve on a log. For the typical bottom-to-top survey, the curve readings before the tool is picked up from the bottom of the hole are not reliable--they are straight lines that do not represent the formation at the depth indicated. With several logging tools in a tool string, the first reading of each curve will be at a different depth, depending on the measure point of each tool.",first reading
Drilling,"The large-diameter metal pipe that connects the bell nipple under the rotary table to the possum belly at the mud tanks. The flowline is simply an inclined, gravity-flow conduit to direct mud coming out the top of the wellbore to the mud surface-treating equipment.

The effectiveness of this type of mechanical diversion to keep the balls in place is strongly dependent on the differential pressure across the perforation and the geometry of the perforation itself.",frac balls
Formation Evaluation,"An early signal in a cement-bond log. In some formations, particularly carbonates of low porosity, it is possible that the first acoustic signal to arrive at the receiver passes through the formation rather than through the casing, and hence its amplitude is unrelated to the cement bond. This manifests itself by a shortening of the transmitter-to-receiver traveltime and by anomalous patterns on the variable-density log. In such cases, it may be assumed that the cement bond is good, as the signal would be unlikely to be transmitted through the formation with sufficient amplitude to be detected if cement bond were poor.",fast formation arrival
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A condition of two fluids that are miscible that is, they form a single phase when mixed in any proportion when first brought into contact at a given pressure and temperature.

The most common device is the spinner flowmeter, but torque flowmeters and crosscorrelation flowmeters also are used. In the 1940s and 1950s, various other surface-metering techniques were tried, but spinner flowmeters emerged as the most suitable for measuring downhole velocities. Spinner and torque flowmeters measure the average velocity of the fluids crossing the device, while crosscorrelation flowmeters measure the velocity of a particular phase. Although not normally called flowmeters, various other techniques measure flow velocity, for example water-flow logs, phase-velocity logs, distributed-temperature logs and even audio measurements.",flowmeter

Well Completions," Shale Gas, Well Workover and Intervention,Another term for hydraulic fracturing, a stimulation treatment routinely performed on oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in opposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.",frac job
Geology,"A break or planar surface in brittle rock across which there is observable displacement. Depending on the relative direction of displacement between the rocks, or fault blocks, on either side of the fault, its movement is described as normal, reverse or strike-slip. According to terminology derived from the mining industry, the fault block above the fault surface is called the hanging wall, while the fault block below the fault is the footwall. Given the geological complexity of some faulted rocks and rocks that have undergone more than one episode of deformation, it can be difficult to distinguish between the various types of faults. Also, areas deformed more than once or that have undergone continual deformation might have fault surfaces that are rotated from their original orientations, so interpretation is not straightforward. In a normal fault, the hanging wall moves down relative to the footwall along the dip of the fault surface, which is steep, from 45o to 90o. A growth fault is a type of normal fault that forms during sedimentation and typically has thicker strata on the downthrown hanging wall than the footwall. A reverse fault forms when the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall parallel to the dip of the fault surface. A thrust fault, sometimes called an overthrust, is a reverse fault in which the fault plane has a shallow dip, typically much less than 45o. Movement of normal and reverse faults can also be oblique as opposed to purely parallel to the dip direction of the fault plane. The motion along a strike-slip fault, also known as a transcurrent or wrench fault, is parallel to the strike of the fault surface, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. The fault surfaces of strike-slip faults are usually nearly vertical. A strike-slip fault in which the block across the fault moves to the right is described as a dextral strike-slip fault. If it moves left, the relative motion is described as sinistral. A transform fault is a particular type of strike-slip fault that is a boundary of an oceanic tectonic plate. The actual movement of a transform fault is opposite to its apparent displacement. The presence of a fault can be detected by observing characteristics of rocks such as changes in lithology from one fault block to the next, breaks and offsets between strata or seismic events, and changes in formation pressure in wells that penetrate both sides of a fault. Some fault surfaces contain relatively coarse rubble that can act as a conduit for migrating oil or gas, whereas the surfaces of other faults are smeared with impermeable clays or broken grains that can act as a fault seal.",fault
Drilling,"A general term for special mechanical devices used to aid the recovery of equipment lost downhole. These devices generally fall into four classes: diagnostic, inside grappling, outside grappling, and force intensifiers or jars. Diagnostic devices may range from a simple impression block made in a soft metal, usually lead, that is dropped rapidly onto the top of the fish so that upon inspection at the surface, the fisherman may be able to custom design a tool to facilitate attachment to and removal of the fish. Other diagnostic tools may include electronic instruments and even downhole sonic or visual-bandwidth cameras. Inside grappling devices, usually called spears, generally have a tapered and threaded profile, enabling the fisherman to first guide the tool into the top of the fish, and then thread the fishing tool into the top of the fish so that recovery may be attempted. Outside grappling devices, usually called overshots, are fitted with threads or another shape that swallows the fish and does not release it as it is pulled out of the hole. Overshots are also fitted with a crude drilling surface at the bottom, so that the overshot may be lightly drilled over the fish, sometimes to remove rock or metallic junk that may be part of the sticking mechanism. Jars are mechanical downhole hammers, which enable the fisherman to deliver high-impact loads to the fish, far in excess of what could be applied in a quasi-static pull from the surface.",fishing tool

The fluids are normally both water, but one may be fresh and the other salty, or else one may contain some tracer, so that the interface can be detected by a production-logging tool. After the tubing is run to the bottom of the well, an interface is introduced by one of two methods. In the static method, the total flow rate is held constant and the relative flow rate of the two streams is changed. The location of the interface after each change is used to determine the flow profile. In the dynamic method, one fluid is pumped at different rates.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A well-stimulation operation in which acid, usually hydrochloric [HCl], is injected into a carbonate formation at a pressure above the formation-fracturing pressure. Flowing acid tends to etch the fracture faces in a nonuniform pattern, forming conductive channels that remain open without a propping agent after the fracture closes. The length of the etched fracture limits the effectiveness of an acid-fracture treatment. The fracture length depends on acid leakoff and acid spending. If acid fluid-loss characteristics are poor, excessive leakoff will terminate fracture extension. Similarly, if the acid spends too rapidly, the etched portion of the fracture will be too short. The major problem in fracture acidizing is the development of wormholes in the fracture face; these wormholes increase the reactive surface area and cause excessive leakoff and rapid spending of the acid. To some extent, this problem can be overcome by using inert fluid-loss additives to bridge wormholes or by using viscosified acids. Fracture acidizing is also called acid fracturing or acid-fracture treatment.",fracture acidizing

Production Testing,"A phenomenon that occurs when the downhole pump rate exceeds the production rate of the formation. It can also be due to the accumulation of low-pressure gas between the valves. On the downstroke of the pump, the gas is compressed, but the pressure inside the barrel does not open the traveling valve until the traveling valve strikes the liquid. Finally when the traveling valve opens, the weight on the rod string can suddenly drop thousands of pounds in a fraction of a second. This condition should be avoided because it causes extreme stresses, which can result in premature equipment failure. Slowing down the pumping unit, shortening the stroke length or installing a smaller bottom hole pump can correct this problem.",fluid pound

The resulting circumferential weld has relatively good strength characteristics but has limitations where the tube is to be plastically deformed or bent, such as occurs on a coiled tubing string. Consequently, butt welds performed on a coiled tubing string should be checked carefully using hardness and radiographic testing methods and their locations detailed in the string record. The anticipated fatigue life in the butt-weld area must also be reduced to compensate for the weakness of the weld.",field weld
Drilling,"A check valve that has a spring-loaded plate (or flapper) that may be pumped through, generally in the downhole direction, but closes if the fluid attempts to flow back through the drillstring to the surface. This reverse flow might be encountered either due to a U-tube effect when the bulk density of the mud in the annulus is higher than that inside the drillpipe, or a well control event.",flapper valve
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"An acid mixture that generates more hydrofluoric [HF] acid as the HF is consumed. In the field, fluoboric acid [HBF4] is easily prepared by mixing boric acid [H3BO3], ammonium bifluoride [NH3F.HF] and hydrochloric acid. Fluoboric acid was developed to counteract the shortcomings associated with mud-acid treatments. It is a retarded fluid that can penetrate deep into the reservoir before spending, especially at high temperatures, and does not contain high HF at any given time. Thus, it is less reactive than mud acid, but its total dissolving power is comparable: HBF4 + H3O --> HBF3OH + HF. The limited amount of HF at any given time decreases the probability of forming precipitates of fluosilicates, fluoaluminates or silica. Fluoboric acid provides permanent stabilization of clays and fines through reactions related to borate and fluoborate ions. For example, borosilicates coat and bind undissolved clays and fines, preventing further mobility of these particles that might plug the formation and impair production. Mud acid does not provide this coating feature. Fluoboric acid also eliminates water sensitivity and is especially recommended in formations containing potassium minerals. Fluoboric acid can be used as a preflush, an overflush or as a main stage in a sandstone matrix acidizing. As a main fluid, a fluoboric acid treatment requires a preflush (weak HCl acid or brine) and should not be overflushed to obtain the maximum stabilization effect in the critical matrix area. Fluoboric acid treatments are the only acid formulations that require long shut-in times because of their long reaction times.",fluoboric acid

Drilling Fluids,"The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",filter cake
Formation Evaluation,"A type of acoustic propagation along the borehole that is visualized as a shaking of the borehole across its diameter. The flexural mode is excited by a dipole source, and measured by dipole receivers oriented in the same direction. Its speed is chiefly a function of the formation shear velocity, the borehole size and fluid velocity, and the frequency. It is used to estimate formation shear velocity, and is the only technique available in slow formations where shear velocity is less than borehole-fluid velocity. In this situation, shear head waves are not generated by a monopole source, so that standard monopole techniques cannot be used. The flexural wave is sensitive to properties of the altered zone, as well as to formation anisotropy, whether intrinsic or stress-induced.",flexural mode
Formation Evaluation,"Fluid in the pore space that can flow under normal reservoir conditions. This fluid may include water, oil or gas, and will flow on production, injection or invasion. When the term is used in connection with nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, it refers to the signal that occurs above a certain cutoff, typically 33 ms in sandstones and 100 ms in carbonates.

Drilling Fluids,"A measurement of the thickness of the filter cake, usually recorded in 32nds-inch. Under dynamic conditions, filter-cake thickness depends on rate of deposition versus erosion caused by fluid circulation and mechanical abrasion by the rotating drillstring. Typically, the filter cake will reach an equilibrium thickness in the wellbore. In laboratory tests, however, filter cake is built under static conditions with no erosion.",filter cake thickness
Well Completions,"A component installed near the bottom of the casing string on which cement plugs land during the primary cementing operation. It typically consists of a short length of casing fitted with a check valve. This device may be a flapper-valve type, a spring-loaded ball valve or other type. The check-valve assembly fixed within the float collar prevents flowback of the cement slurry when pumping is stopped. Without a float collar, the cement slurry placed in the annulus could U-tube, or reverse flow back into the casing. The greater density of cement slurries than the displacement mud inside the casing causes the U-tube effect.",float collar
Production Logging,"A distortion of the magnetic flux that has been introduced into a casing by a low-frequency electromagnet or permanent magnet. The principle of flux leakage is used to detect casing corrosion, since flux leakage is caused by rapid changes in the thickness of the casing and by pits and holes in either the internal or external wall. Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall. The results are often combined with a high-frequency, eddy-current measurement, designed to detect flaws only on the inner wall.",flux leakage

Drilling,"A full-sized length of casing placed at the bottom of the casing string that is usually left full of cement on the inside to ensure that good cement remains on the outside of the bottom of the casing. If cement were not left inside the casing in this manner, the risk of overdisplacing the cement (due to improper casing volume calculations, displacement mud volume measurements, or both) would be significantly higher. Hence, the well designer plans on a safety margin of cement left inside the casing to guarantee that the fluid left outside the casing is good-quality cement. A float collar is placed at the top of the float joint and a float shoe placed at the bottom to prevent reverse flow of cement back into the casing after placement. There can be one, two or three joints of casing used for this purpose.",float joint

Well Completions,"A rounded profile component attached to the downhole end of a casing string. An integral check valve in the float shoe prevents reverse flow, or U-tubing, of cement slurry from the annulus into the casing or flow of wellbore fluids into the casing string as it is run. The float shoe also guides the casing toward the center of the hole to minimize hitting rock ledges or washouts as the casing is run into the wellbore. The float shoe reduces hook weight. With controlled or partial fill-up as the string is run, the casing string can be floated into position, avoiding the need for the rig to carry the entire weight of the casing string. The outer portions of the float shoe are made of steel and generally match the casing size and threads, although not necessarily the casing grade. The inside (including the taper) is usually made of cement or thermoplastic, since this material must be drilled out if the well is to be deepened beyond the casing point.",float shoe

For that reason, the well designer usually specifies a maximum free-water content for the slurry.",free water
Well Completions,"The aqueous phase that separates from a slurry or mixture of fluids. In cementing operations, free water is undesirable since channels tend to form through the set cement, providing potential gas migration paths.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Also known as injection pattern, the particular arrangement of production and injection wells. The injection pattern for an individual field or part of a field is based on the location of existing wells, reservoir size and shape, cost of new wells and the recovery increase associated with various injection patterns. The flood pattern can be altered during the life of a field to change the direction of flow in a reservoir with the intent of contacting unswept oil. It is common to reduce the pattern size by infill drilling, which improves oil recovery by increasing reservoir continuity between injectors and producers. Common injection patterns are direct line drive, staggered line drive, two-spot, three-spot, four-spot, five-spot, seven-spot and nine-spot. Normally, the two-spot and three-spot patterns are used for pilot testing purposes. The patterns are called normal or regular when they include only one production well per pattern.

Heavy Oil,"An oil-continuous foam that contains dispersed gas bubbles produced at the wellhead from heavy oil reservoirs under solution gas drive. The nature of the gas dispersions in oil distinguishes foamy oil behavior from conventional heavy oil. The gas that comes out of solution in the reservoir does not coalesce into large gas bubbles nor into a continuous flowing gas phase. Instead it remains as small bubbles entrained in the crude oil, keeping the effective oil viscosity low while providing expansive energy that helps drive the oil toward the producing well. Foamy oil accounts for unusually high production in heavy oil reservoirs under solution-gas drive.",foamy oil

Geology,"A wave-like geologic structure that forms when rocks deform by bending instead of breaking under compressional stress. Anticlines are arch-shaped folds in which rock layers are upwardly convex. The oldest rock layers form the core of the fold, and outward from the core progressively younger rocks occur. A syncline is the opposite type of fold, having downwardly convex layers with young rocks in the core. Folds typically occur in anticline-syncline pairs. The hinge is the point of maximum curvature in a fold. The limbs occur on either side of the fold hinge. The imaginary surface bisecting the limbs of the fold is called the axial surface. The axial surface is called the axial plane in cases where the fold is symmetrical and the lines containing the points of maximum curvature of the folded layers, or hinge lines, are coplanar.

Formation Evaluation,"A core that is in the same state as when it was brought to the surface. A fresh core is sealed as soon as possible after retrieval from the well to minimize the loss of fluids and exposure to air. The term implies that the core is analyzed before being stored, after storage it is known as preserved core. Since the purpose is to minimize alteration, a fresh core has often been drilled with a bland mud, either water- or oil-base, but with a minimum of chemical additives and weighting material.",fresh core
Reservoir Characterization,"Devices for selecting or excluding data from a data stream or data set. These devices may be physical (for example to tune an electrical circuit to a particular frequency) or a mathematical algorithm. Mathematical filters take many forms, some of which are used in oilfield data analysis and interpretation. Examples include statistical techniques, geostatistical techniques, clustering, conditional algorithm, etc. A simple example of a conditional algorithm might include using a caliper to determine whether a borehole was rugose, thus requiring special log interpretation through the rugose interval.",filters
Well Workover and Intervention,"The design, strategies and principles for ensuring that there is uninterrupted hydrocarbon production flowing from the reservoir to the point of sale. Impediments to hydrocarbon flow in wellbores and flowlines may arise from an interrelated combination of effects involving flow dynamics—single and multiphase fluid flow—and production chemistry. At reservoir pressure and temperature conditions, fluids are single phase. As they travel toward the production facility, the fluids experience changes in pressure and temperature that result in multiple fluid phases and the formation, accumulation and dispersal of inorganic and organic solids that may become impediments to production. Multiphase flow may cause phenomena such as slugging in subsea flowlines and risers. Solids deposition may cause flowline plugging anywhere in the system. Historically, production impediments in wellbores and flowlines are well-known in onshore and shallow water environments, where they have been managed using thermal, mechanical and chemical means. The long flowlines connecting a wellhead or manifold to a production facility are exposed to low temperatures and high pressures. In these deepwater environments, intervention technologies and operations are expensive because they typically require deepwater vessels or a rig. Personnel responsible for flow assurance should have advanced knowledge of flow dynamics and production chemistry.",flow assurance
Drilling Fluids,"The simplest aldehyde, having the formula HCHO. Formaldehyde is used in aqueous solutions as a preservative. In muds, paraformaldehyde is added to protect against bacterial attack.

Geophysics,"A frequency- and range-dependent area of a reflector from which most of the energy of a reflection is returned and arrival times differ by less than half a period from the first break, named for French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788 to 1827). Waves with such arrival times will interfere constructively and so be detected as a single arrival. Subsurface features smaller than the Fresnel zone usually cannot be detected using seismic waves.",Fresnel zone
Formation Evaluation,"The downward vertical movement of filtrate with time after invasion. In hydrocarbon zones, the filtrate is heavier than the formation fluid. Therefore, in a vertical well, gravity causes the filtrate to sink to the bottom of a permeable zone, while the hydrocarbons move back to the borehole at the top. In a horizontal well, the mud filtrate will sink below the well, leaving hydrocarbons above it. The amount of movement depends, among other factors, on the time since invasion, the fluid mobilities and the difference in fluid densities. In water zones, the direction of movement depends on the relative densities of filtrate and formation water. In the more usual case of fresh filtrate and salty formation water, the filtrate will move upwards.",filtrate slump

Drilling Fluids,"A chemical or isotopic marker that is uniformly distributed in the continuous phase of a drilling, coring, drill-in or completion fluid and used to later identify the filtrate in cores or in fluids sampled from permeable strata. A tracer must become a part of the filtrate, remaining in true solution and moving with the filtrate into permeable zones. It must not be a component in the strata that is expected to migrate, be adsorbed on clays, or degraded. It should be measurable in trace amounts and safe to handle. Examples of filtrate tracers include: (1) Radioactively tagged compounds (isotopes of elements). Tritium, a weakly-emitting radioisotope of hydrogen, can be a safe and effective tracer in both oil and water (as T2O) muds. It is measured by scintillation counts. (2) Bromide or iodide compounds are practical to use because they do not occur naturally in most muds or reservoirs. They are detectable in small amounts by electron-capture gas chromatography. (3) Fatty acids (or their derivatives) normally present in an oil-mud emulsifier can serve as oil-filtrate tracers and are analyzed by gas chromatography. (4) Nitrate (NO3-) anion, added as sodium, potassium or calcium nitrate, is one of the earliest tracers used. It is limited by being difficult to analyze and lost by degradation.",filtrate tracer
Drilling,"Alteration of the far-field or virgin characteristics of a producing formation, usually by exposure to drilling fluids. The water or solid particles in the drilling fluids, or both, tend to decrease the pore volume and effective permeability of the producible formation in the near-wellbore region. At least two mechanisms are at work. First, solid particles from the drilling fluid physically plug or bridge across flowpaths in the porous formation. Second, when water contacts certain clay minerals in the formation, the clay typically swells, increasing in volume and decreasing the pore volume. Third, chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the formation rock and fluids can precipitate solids or semisolids that plug pore spaces. One approach to minimize formation damage is to use drill-in or completion fluids that are specially formulated to avoid damage to the formation when drilling pay zones, rather than ordinary drilling fluids.",formation damage
Drilling Fluids,"A reduction in the natural capability of a reservoir to produce its fluids, such as a decrease in porosity or permeability, or both. Damage can occur near the wellbore face (easier to repair) or deep into the rock (harder to repair). Damage is caused by several mechanisms: (1) physical plugging of pores by mud solids, (2) alteration of reservoir rock wettability, (3) precipitation of insoluble materials in pore spaces, (4) clay swelling in pore spaces, (5) migration of fines into pore throats, (6) introduction of an immobile phase, and (7) emulsion formation and blockage. Damage can occur when sensitive formations are exposed to drilling fluids.",formation damage
Well Completions,"A general term to describe the reduction in permeability to the near-wellbore area of a reservoir formation. There are several recognized damage mechanisms, such as the invasion of incompatible fluids swelling the formation clays, or fine solids from dirty fluids plugging the formation matrix. Because formation damage can significantly affect the productivity of any well, adequate precautions should be exercised to avoid damage during all phases in the life of a well.",formation damage
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Natural or induced production impairments that can develop in the reservoir, the near-wellbore area or the perforations. Natural damage occurs as produced reservoir fluids move through the reservoir, while induced damage is the result of external operations and fluids in the well, such as drilling, well completion, workover operations or stimulation treatments. Some induced damage triggers natural damage mechanisms. Natural damage includes phenomena such as fines migration, clay swelling, scale formation, organic deposition, including paraffins or asphaltenes, and mixed organic and inorganic deposition. Induced damage includes plugging caused by foreign particles in the injected fluid, wettability changes, emulsions, precipitates or sludges caused by acid reactions, bacterial activity and water blocks. Wellbore cleanup or matrix stimulation treatments are two different operations that can remove natural or induced damage. Selecting the proper operation depends on the location and nature of the damage.",formation damage

Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as transition flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow, and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",froth flow

Drilling," Shale Gas,Also known as logging while drilling or LWD, the measurement of formation properties during the excavation of the hole, or shortly thereafter, through the use of tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly. LWD, while sometimes risky and expensive, has the advantage of measuring properties of a formation before drilling fluids invade deeply. Further, many wellbores prove to be difficult or even impossible to measure with conventional wireline tools, especially highly deviated wells. In these situations, the LWD measurement ensures that some measurement of the subsurface is captured in the event that wireline operations are not possible. Timely LWD data can also be used to guide well placement so that the wellbore remains within the zone of interest or in the most productive portion of a reservoir, such as in highly variable shale reservoirs.",formation evaluation while drilling

Formation Evaluation,"The ratio of the resistivity of a rock filled with water (Ro) to the resistivity of that water (Rw). G.E. Archie postulated that the formation factor (F) was a constant independent of Rw and solely a function of pore geometry (the Archie equation I). It has since been shown that F is independent of Rw only for a certain class of petrophysically simple rocks (Archie rocks). In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, there is a more complex dependence. In such cases, the ratio Ro/Rw is known as the apparent formation factor and may vary with Rw , temperature and the type of ion in solution. The intrinsic formation factor is then defined as F corrected for the effect of shale, or else the value of Ro/Rw at the limit of high salinity (low Rw ). The correction for the effect of shale depends on the saturation equation used, for example Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM. Unless otherwise stated, the term formation factor usually refers to the apparent formation factor. F has been related to porosity (phi) by several formulae (Archie, Humble and others) that have the general expression F = a / phim, where a is a constant and m the porosity exponent.",formation factor

The most common device is the spinner flowmeter, but torque flowmeters and crosscorrelation flowmeters also are used. In the 1940s and 1950s, various other surface-metering techniques were tried, but spinner flowmeters emerged as the most suitable for measuring downhole velocities. Spinner and torque flowmeters measure the average velocity of the fluids crossing the device, while crosscorrelation flowmeters measure the velocity of a particular phase.

Geology,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures.

Production Logging,"A record of the fraction of gas present at different depths in the borehole. Although several techniques may be used for this purpose, the term usually refers to logs based on one of two principles. In the first, four or more optical probes are used to detect the passage of gas bubbles at different points across the borehole. As with other local probes, holdup is determined by the fraction of time the probe detects gas. In the second technique, a 57Co (cobalt) source emits low-energy gamma rays that undergo backscattering and photoelectric absorption in the borehole fluid before being counted in a detector.

Production Logging,"A device for measuring the density of fluids in a completed well, using a radioactive source of gamma rays and a detector. In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement. Compared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution. On the other hand, it is not affected by well deviation, friction or kinetic effects.",gamma ray densitometer
Geology,"A bounding surface in a reservoir above which predominantly gas occurs and below which predominantly water occurs. Gas and water are somewhat miscible, so the contact between gas and water is not necessarily sharp and there is typically a transition zone between 100% gas and 100% water in reservoirs.",gas water contact
Drilling,"To control the direction of a well based on the results of downhole geological logging measurements rather than three-dimensional targets in space, usually to keep a directional wellbore within a pay zone.

Gravity override causes sweep inhomogeneities that can be mitigated through foam flooding.",gravity override
Formation Evaluation,"Phenomena resulting from the transfer of energy from a gamma ray to matter, usually to an electron. The probability of a specific interaction occurring depends on the atomic number of the material and the energy of the gamma ray.

Drilling,A common and inexpensive measurement of the natural emission of gamma rays by a formation. Gamma ray logs are particularly helpful because shales and sandstones typically have different gamma ray signatures that can be correlated readily between wells.,gamma ray log
Formation Evaluation,"A log of the total natural radioactivity, measured in API units. The measurement can be made in both openhole and through casing. The depth of investigation is a few inches, so that the log normally measures the flushed zone. Shales and clays are responsible for most natural radioactivity, so the gamma ray log often is a good indicator of such rocks. However, other rocks are also radioactive, notably some carbonates and feldspar-rich rocks. The log is also used for correlation between wells, for depth correlation between open and cased hole, and for depth correlation between logging runs. The gamma ray log was the first nuclear well log and was introduced in the late 1930s.",gamma ray log

Drilling Fluids,"A crystalline solid consisting of water with gas molecules in an ice-like cage structure. The general term for this type of solid is clathrate. Water molecules form a lattice structure into which many types of gas molecules can fit. Most gases, except hydrogen and helium, can form hydrates. C1 to nC5 hydrocarbons, H2S and CO2 readily form hydrates at low temperature and high pressure. Heavier hydrocarbons may also enter the structure but do not form hydrates by themselves. Gas-cut muds can form hydrates in deepwater drilling operations, plugging BOP lines, risers and subsea wellheads, causing a well-control risk. Gas hydrates are thermodynamically suppressed by adding antifreeze materials such as salts or glycols. A common practice is to use 20 to 23 wt.% NaCl. Nucleation and growth of hydrates can be dynamically inhibited by certain polymers or surfactants. Gas hydrates are found in nature, on the bottom of cold seas and in arctic permafrost regions. Drilling into these can be hazardous, but they offer another source of hydrocarbons for future exploitation.

Geophysics,"The velocity that wave energy—comprised of a wave group, train or packet of individual wave phases or components—travels through a medium. The wave energy may be grouped into an envelope that is shrink-wrapped around it. The shape of the envelope around the wave-energy group changes with distance because the individual wave phases move apart from one another. vg = vp − λ (∂vp/∂λ) = vp + f (∂vp/∂f) Relation of group velocity to phase velocity. As a wave travels through a medium, its energy moves at the group velocity (vg) and its individual phases, or components, move at their phase velocity (vp). The wave changes shape with distance as each frequency (f), or wavelength (λ), component moves at its separate phase velocity through the phenomenon of dispersion. Relative to the group velocity, each component moves with faster or slower phase velocity, depending on how phase velocity changes with wavelength or frequency.",group velocity
Well Completions,"A condition in pumping and processing equipment caused by the induction of free gas. The compressible gas interferes with the proper operation of valves and other pump components, preventing the intake of fluid.",gas lock
Production Testing,"A condition sometimes encountered in a pumping well when dissolved gas, released from solution during the upstroke of the plunger, appears as free gas between the valves. On the downstroke, pressure inside a barrel completely filled with gas may never reach the pressure needed to open the traveling valve. In the upstroke, the pressure inside the barrel never decreases enough for the standing valve to open and allow liquid to enter the pump. Thus no fluid enters or leaves the pump, and the pump is locked. It does not cause equipment failure, but with a nonfunctional pump, the pumping system is useless. A decrease in pumping rate is accompanied by an increase of bottomhole pressure (or fluid level in the annulus). In many cases of gas lock, this increase in bottomhole pressure can exceed the pressure in the barrel and liquid can enter through the standing valve. After a few strokes, enough liquid enters the pump that the gas lock in broken, and the pump functions normally.",gas lock

Its water solutions are non-Newtonian and also can be cross-linked by borax to give very high gel strength for suspension. Such a structure is easily broken by breakers in fracturing fluids, so it serves as a carrier for placing sand far back into fractures. It is also used as a top-hole drilling fluid.

The GPTS was developed by thorough study of rocks from around the world, during which it was observed that rocks from specific time periods contained magnetic minerals whose orientation was opposite to that of the current magnetic field. By comparing the patterns of magnetic reversals with those of rocks of known age, the approximate ages of rocks can be established.

Drilling,"A tapered, often bullet-nosed piece of equipment often found on the bottom of a casing string. The device guides the casing toward the center of the hole and minimizes problems associated with hitting rock ledges or washouts in the wellbore as the casing is lowered into the well. The outer portions of the guide shoe are made from steel, generally matching the casing in size and threads, if not steel grade. The inside (including the taper) is generally made of cement or thermoplastic, since this material must be drilled out if the well is to be deepened beyond the casing point. It differs from a float shoe in that it lacks a check valve.",guide shoe
Geology,A porous sand layer or sand body charged with natural gas.,gas sand
Geology,"The periodic switching of the magnetic north and south poles of the Earth throughout time, probably as a result of movement of fluid within the Earth's core. The onset and duration of the many episodes of reversed polarity have been documented by examining the polarity of magnetic minerals within rocks of different ages from around the world, particularly in basalts or igneous rocks of the oceanic crust. Oceanic basalts record the Earth's magnetic field as they solidify from molten lava symmetrically on each side of the midoceanic ridges. These data have been compiled to create a time scale known as the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). In the oil field, borehole recordings allow direct correlation to GPTS and well-to-well correlations.",geomagnetic polarity reversal
Production Logging,"A device for measuring the average density of the fluid at different depths in a completed production or injection well to produce a fluid-density log. Knowing the density of the individual phases allows their holdups to be determined, directly in the case of biphasic flow, and in combination with other measurements for triphasic flow. Introduced in the late 1950s, the gradiomanometer measures the pressure difference between two pressure sensors, placed approximately 2 ft [0.6 m] apart. The pressure difference reflects the average fluid density across the well within that depth interval. The resolution is high, around 0.005 g/cm3, but the accuracy can be affected by a friction effect, a kinetic effect and well deviation. The effect of deviation can be corrected, but the sensitivity to holdup is reduced as the deviation increases until it is zero in a horizontal well. Note: Gradiomanometer is a mark of Schlumberger. It is now a commonly accepted term for a certain tool that measures differential pressure.",gradiomanometer

As used in log and core analysis, the term 'grain' refers to all the solid material in the rock, since, when interpreting the measurements, no effort is made to distinguish grains from other solid material. The grain density of core samples is calculated from the measured dry weight divided by the grain volume. In logs, grain density is calculated from the density log, using an estimate of porosity and knowledge of the fluid content.",grain density

Air guns are also used in water-filled pits on land as an energy source during acquisition of vertical seismic profiles. A water gun is a source of energy for acquisition of marine seismic data that shoots water from a chamber in the tool into a larger body of water, creating cavitation. The cavity is a vacuum and implodes without creating secondary bubbles. This provides a short time signature and higher resolution than an air-gun source.",gun
Perforating,"A device used to perforate oil and gas wells in preparation for production.

Drilling,"Gas that rises to the surface, usually detected because it reduces the density of the drilling mud. Gas detectors, which the mud logger monitors, measure combustible gases (methane, ethane, butane and others). The mud logger reports total gas, individual gas components, or both, on the mud log. In extreme cases, gas visibly bubbles out of the mud as it returns to the surface.

Perforating,"The distance between the external surface of the gun assembly and the internal surface of the casing or liner. The gun clearance depends on the position of the gun within the tubular and will vary between phases of shots on any gun unless the gun assembly is centralized. This variation in clearance contributes to variable performance of the perforations. The greater the gun clearance, the smaller the entrance hole-with the effect increasing with depth (pressure).",gun clearance
Formation Evaluation,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The geometrical factor can be radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool; vertical, reflecting the response along the tool axis; or two-dimensional, reflecting both. It can also be a differential geometrical factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance; or integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The term geometrical factor was introduced for induction logging since it gave a convenient method for computing the reading in a heterogeneous environment. For example, in an invaded formation the log reading, Clog, can be written as: Clog = Gi * Cxo + (1 - Gi) * Ct where Gi is the geometrical factor for a diameter of invasion Di, and Cxo and Ct are the conductivities of the invaded zone and the undisturbed zone. A true geometrical factor depends only on the geometry of the volume concerned, which in practice is only true for induction logs at zero conductivity. However, the term has come to be used for other cases and for other measurements even though the geometrical factor depends significantly on formation properties. The correct term for these cases is the pseudogeometrical factor.",geometrical factor

Geophones detect motion in only one direction. Conventional seismic surveys on land use one geophone per receiver location to detect motion in the vertical direction. Three mutually orthogonal geophones are typically used in combination to collect 3C seismic data. Hydrophones, unlike geophones, detect changes in pressure rather than motion.",geophone

Perforating,"The point on a gun assembly or perforating string that is used when correlating depth. With use of a surface depth reference or datum point, any convenient point may be used, providing it is applied accurately and consistently. For downhole correlation on wireline applications, the gun zero point will relate to the correlating device, such as the casing collar locator (CCL) or gamma ray log tool. For nonwireline applications, the gun zero point will relate to the locating device, such as the tubing-end locator. The correlation process is crucial to a successful perforating operation; and therefore the importance of ensuring correct placement of the gun assembly prior to firing cannot be overstated.",gun zero

Production Logging,"A record of the quality of a gravel pack and the quantity of solid particles it contains. The traditional logging technique uses a type of nuclear fluid densimeter, with a gamma ray source and a single detector. The number of gamma rays reaching the detector is inversely proportional to the gravel-pack density. The count rate is used qualitatively, being scaled in each well between zones with 100% pack and zero pack, or else compared before and after a repair to the pack. The density measurement is not entirely independent of the formation, and is not effective when the density of the particles and the completion fluid are similar. In these cases, a neutron activation or neutron-porosity measurement may be used. Other techniques include a neutron porosity log and tracer measurements. Radioactive tracers may be coated on the outside of the particles or else included within the particles. They can be detected by gamma ray logs, or if a variety of tracers is used they can be tracked with a multiple-isotope log.",gravel pack log

Drilling Fluids,"A calcium-based water mud system containing gypsum. Gyp mud can be used for drilling shales, but it is also well-suited for drilling gypsum, anhydrite and salt stringers. An advantage of gyp over lime muds is that the pH of gyp mud need not be so high because it contains more soluble Ca+2 to inhibit shale swelling. Gypsum, CaSO4·2H2O, content is measured by an API test, and more can be added as needed. A calcium-tolerant clay deflocculant may be needed to control viscosity. Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and starch are used for fluid loss control along with a small amount of prehydrated bentonite.",gyp mud
Drilling," Drilling Fluids,A drilling fluid (or mud) that has gas (air or natural gas) bubbles in it, resulting in a lower bulk, unpressurized density compared with a mud not cut by gas. The density of gas-cut mud can be measured accurately using a pressurized mud balance. Defoamer chemicals added to the mud or a mechanical vacuum pump degasser can liberate the trapped gas. The derrickman periodically measures mud density and communicates the results to the drilling crew via an intercom, typically reporting something like 9.6 heavy, 10.4, or 13.2 light, indicating more than 9.6 pounds per gallon, 10.4 pounds per gallon, or less than 13.2 pounds per gallon, respectively. Each tenth of a pound per gallon is referred to as a point of mud weight. Note that for this low-accuracy measurement, no direct mention of gas cut is made. A gas cut is inferred only if the mud returning to the surface is significantly less dense than it should be. In the case of the mud logger's measurement, units of gas (having virtually no absolute meaning) are reported. For the mud logger's measurement, a direct indication of combustible gases is made, with no direct correlation to mud weight.",gas cut mud

The common oilfield usage, however, is to indicate anomalous subsurface pore pressure that is higher or lower than the normal, predicted hydrostatic pressure for a given depth, or the pressure exerted per unit area by a column of fresh water from sea level to a given depth. Abnormally low pore pressure might occur in areas where fluids have been drained, such as a depleted hydrocarbon reservoir. Abnormally high pore pressure might occur in areas where burial of water-filled sediments by an impermeable sediment such as clay was so rapid that fluids could not escape and the pore pressure increased with deeper burial.",geopressure
Drilling,"[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",H2S
Well Workover and Intervention," Well Completions,A poisonous liquid acid composed of hydrogen and fluorine. Hydrofluoric acid [HF] is used primarily because it is the only common, inexpensive mineral acid that can dissolve siliceous minerals. HF is typically mixed with hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. These mixtures, also called mud acids, are considered the main fluid in a sandstone acid treatment because they remove formation damage. Hydrofluoric acid should not be used in sandstone formations with high carbonate content because of the high risk of calcium fluoride precipitation [CaF2].",HF

It is commonly calculated with the equation HHP=P*Q/1714, where P stands for pressure in pounds per square in., Q stands for flow rate in gallons per minute, and 1714 is a conversion factor necessary to yield HHP in terms of horsepower. Bit manufacturers often recommend that fluid hydraulics energy across the bit nozzles be in a particular HHP range, for example 2.0 to 7.0 HHP, to ensure adequate bit tooth and bottom-of-hole cleaning (the minimum HHP) and to avoid premature erosion of the bit itself (the maximum HHP).",HHP
Drilling,"A subset of the more general term directional drilling, used where the departure of the wellbore from vertical exceeds about 80 degrees. Note that some horizontal wells are designed such that after reaching true 90-degree horizontal, the wellbore may actually start drilling upward. In such cases, the angle past 90 degrees is continued, as in 95 degrees, rather than reporting it as deviation from vertical, which would then be 85 degrees. Because a horizontal well typically penetrates a greater length of the reservoir, it can offer significant production improvement over a vertical well.",horizontal drilling
Shale Gas,"The intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take to a horizontal trajectory. Horizontal lateral sections can be designed to intersect natural fractures or simply to contact more of the productive formation. Horizontal drilling is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken downhole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components, including rotary steerable systems and drill bits. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: Direct the bit in the direction that one wants to drill. By placing a bend near the bit in a downhole steerable mud motor, the bend points the bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit turns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that direction may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) such that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the wellbore axis. Instead, the bit sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating, usually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes. Horizontal drilling is common in shale reservoirs because it allows drillers to place the borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock.",horizontal drilling
Drilling,"A measure of the energy per unit of time that is being expended across the bit nozzles. It is commonly calculated with the equation HHP=P*Q/1714, where P stands for pressure in pounds per square in., Q stands for flow rate in gallons per minute, and 1714 is a conversion factor necessary to yield HHP in terms of horsepower. Bit manufacturers often recommend that fluid hydraulics energy across the bit nozzles be in a particular HHP range, for example 2.0 to 7.0 HHP, to ensure adequate bit tooth and bottom-of-hole cleaning (the minimum HHP) and to avoid premature erosion of the bit itself (the maximum HHP).",hydraulic horsepower

Geology,"[NaCl] A soft, soluble evaporite mineral commonly known as salt or rock salt. Because salt is less dense than many sedimentary rocks, it is relatively buoyant and can form salt domes, pillars or curtains by flowing and breaking through or piercing overlying sediments, as seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Zagros fold belt. Halite can be critical in forming hydrocarbon traps and seals because it tends to flow rather than fracture during deformation, thus preventing hydrocarbons from leaking out of a trap even during and after some types of deformation.",halite

Hardness ions develop from dissolved minerals, bicarbonate, carbonate, sulfate and chloride. Bicarbonate salts cause temporary hardness, which can be removed by boiling the water and leaving behind a calcium carbonate solid. Mg+2 and Fe+2 ions can be removed by raising the pH (with NaOH or KOH) and then allowing the precipitated Fe(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 to settle out. Calcium hardness can be removed by adding excess sodium carbonate to precipitate Ca+2 as CaCO3. Hard water can be passed through an ion exchange column where hardness ions are captured on the resin. Removal of hardness is the process called water softening.",hardness ion
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"An enhanced oil recovery process utilizing compressed air that is injected into a reservoir. Oxygen in the gas reacts exothermically with some of the oil, producing highly mobile flue gas. The flue gas advances ahead of the reaction front and achieves an efficient displacement of the in situ oil. Scientists believe that the high displacement efficiency of high-pressure air injection is due to a combination of processes that include immiscible gas displacement, improved miscibility caused by the presence of CO2 in the flue gas, reduction in interfacial tension, oil swelling and reservoir repressurization. The process is typically used for deep, tight, relatively light-oil reservoirs where water injectivity is low.",high pressure air injection

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The process whereby hydrogen causes steel components to become less resistant to breakage and generally much weaker in tensile strength. While embrittlement has many causes, in the oil field it is usually the result of exposure to gaseous or liquid hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. On a molecular level, hydrogen ions work their way between the grain boundaries of the steel, where hydrogen ions recombine into molecular hydrogen [H2], taking up more space and weakening the bonds between the grains. The formation of molecular hydrogen can cause sudden metal failure due to cracking when the metal is subjected to tensile stress. This type of hydrogen-induced failure is produced when hydrogen atoms enter high strength steels. The failures due to hydrogen embrittlement normally have a period where no damage is observed, which is called incubation, followed by a sudden catastrophic failure.

Drilling," Drilling Fluids, Production Facilities, Well Testing, Well Workover and Intervention, Well Completions,[H2S] An extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual. Hydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas. Hydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing. Sulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.",hydrogen sulfide

In multiphase flow, each fluid moves at a different speed due to different gravitational forces and other factors, with the heavier phase moving slower, or being more held up, than the lighter phase. The holdup of a particular fluid is not the same as the proportion of the total flow rate due to that fluid, also known as its cut. To determine in-situ flow rates, it is necessary to measure the holdup and velocity of each fluid. Holdup is usually given the symbol y, with the suffixes g, o or w for gas, oil or water.

The HLB system is a semi-empirical method to predict what type of surfactant properties a molecular structure will provide. The HLB system is based on the concept that some molecules have hydrophilic groups, other molecules have lipophilic groups, and some have both. Weight percentage of each type of group on a molecule or in a mixture predicts what behavior the molecular structure will exhibit. Water-in-oil emulsifiers have a low HLB numbers, typically around 4.

Geology,The height of a column of freshwater that exerts pressure at a given depth. Some authors use the term synonymously with hydrostatic pressure.,hydrostatic head
Drilling,"The vertical height of a fluid column, regardless of the length or other dimensions of that fluid column. For example, a deviated wellbore has a longer length than vertical depth. The hydrostatic head at any point in that wellbore is not a function of its measured depth (MD) along the wellbore axis, but rather its vertical distance or true vertical depth (TVD) to the surface. The term head or hydrostatic head is also commonly used as a measure of the output of centrifugal pumps, usually expressed in feet of head or psi. Since this type of pump is a centrifugal (or velocity) device, the capability of the pump as expressed in feet of head is independent of the density of the fluid being pumped. For example, if a pump is rated as producing sixty feet of head, it will pump a column of fluid up an open-ended vertical pipe until the top of the liquid is 60 ft [18 m] above the discharge of the pump, regardless of the density of the liquid being pumped.",hydrostatic head

Drilling Fluids,"The pressure at any point in a column of fluid caused by the weight of fluid above that point. Controlling the hydrostatic pressure of a mud column is a critical part of mud engineering. Mud weight must be monitored and adjusted to always stay within the limits imposed by the drilling situation. Sufficient hydrostatic pressure (mud weight) is necessary to prevent an influx of fluids from downhole, but excessive pressure must also be avoided to prevent creation of hydraulic fractures in the formation, which would cause lost circulation. Hydrostatic pressure is calculated from mud weight and true vertical depth as follows:Hydrostatic pressure, psi = 0.052 x Mud Weight, lbm/gal x True Vertical Depth, ft.

Induced polarization is observed when a steady current through two electrodes in the Earth is shut off: the voltage does not return to zero instantaneously, but rather decays slowly, indicating that charge has been stored in the rocks. This charge, which accumulates mainly at interfaces between clay minerals, is responsible for the IP effect. This effect can be measured in either the time domain by observing the rate of decay of voltage or in the frequency domain by measuring phase shifts between sinusoidal currents and voltages.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The particular arrangement of production and injection wells. The injection pattern for an individual field or part of a field is based on the location of existing wells, reservoir size and shape, cost of new wells and the recovery increase associated with various injection patterns. The flood pattern can be altered during the life of a field to change the direction of flow in a reservoir with the intent of contacting unswept oil. It is common to reduce the pattern size by infill drilling, which improves oil recovery by increasing reservoir continuity between injectors and producers. Common injection patterns are direct line drive, staggered line drive, two-spot, three-spot, four-spot, five-spot, seven-spot and nine-spot. Normally, the two-spot and three-spot patterns are used for pilot testing purposes. The patterns are called normal or regular when they include only one production well per pattern. Patterns are described as inverted when they include only one injection well per pattern.",injection pattern

Production Logging,"An in-situ recording in which a material with high neutron-capture cross section is injected into the flowstream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. The material used is normally borax or water with high salinity, both of which cause a significant increase in the capture cross section measured by a pulsed-neutron log. In the most common application, the material is injected across the producing intervals of a production well. By comparing pulsed neutron logs recorded before and after injection, the injectivity, and hence productivity, of each interval can be estimated. Any cement channels or leaks will also be observed.",injection pulsed neutron log

Well Testing,"The testing of wells in which fluid is being injected into the reservoir. The most common type of test is a falloff test, in which injection is halted and the pressure decline is measured as a function of time. The most common situation is a waterflood. In many reservoirs, the formation pressure is high enough to maintain a full column of fluid in the wellbore and the pressure can be monitored at the surface. The bottomhole pressure is then calculated by adding the weight of the fluid column to the surface pressure. Gas-injection wells, although less common, lend themselves to similar testing. The rise in fluid pressure as a function of time while injection is taking place could theoretically be used also, but this type of approach is rarely used. The equations and theory for these tests are an exact mirror image of those for buildup and drawdown testing. Calculated results for these wells are usually good because the formations are commonly liquid-filled. Frequently water-injection wells are inadvertently fractured at some time in their life and consequently have a negative skin effect.",injection well testing

Potentially damaging particles in drilling fluids include clays, cuttings, weighting agents and fluid-loss control materials. In workover and stimulation fluids, suspended solids include bacteria and polymer residues. Foreign plugging particles can also be introduced as a result of poor water-handling practices. These foreign particles include debris from tanks and tubing.",induced particle plugging
Formation Evaluation,"The process by which mud filtrate, and sometimes whole mud, enters a permeable formation. The mud filtrate displaces some or all of the moveable fluids in the formation, leaving an invaded zone. The invasion process is complex. It is generally considered to start with a short initial spurt loss when the bit penetrates the rock. During this period, invasion depends on formation permeability, among other factors. A mudcake is soon formed, after which invasion is either described as dynamic, when mud is being circulated, or static, when it is not. In both cases, the volume of invasion depends little on formation properties and strongly on other factors such as mudcake permeability and differential pressure. However, the profile of the invasion front within the formation, both vertically and radially, does depend on formation properties. With high permeability and with different densities of filtrate and formation fluid, gravity can cause vertical movement of the filtrate, leading to different depths of invasion at the top and bottom of a zone. With two moveable phases (oil and water) and differing permeabilities, an annulus can be formed. The radial profile from the wellbore out to the undisturbed zone depends on permeability, with lower permeabilities leading to sharper transitions.",invasion
Formation Evaluation,"Pertaining to the influence of invasion on the response of logging measurements. For example, an invasion correction is the correction made to a deep-reading measurement such as an induction log for the effect of the invaded zone. The correction is based on a suitable invasion model, such as a step profile or transition zone model.",invasion
Formation Evaluation,"The use of repeated forward modeling of a logging tool response to produce modeled logs that very closely match the measured logs. The final model is then the log analyst?s best estimate of the formation properties. Iterative forward modeling is a hand-operated inversion. The technique is used mainly for laterologs and induction logs when the formation or the environment are complex, so that the environmental effects cannot be separated and treated individually by automatic inversion. Iterative forward modeling allows the log analyst to use local knowledge and petrophysics to select between the many possible solutions that are mathematically correct. These cases occur most often in horizontal wells, or vertical wells with the combined effects of invasion and large resistivity contrast between beds.",iterative forward modeling
Geophysics,"An electromagnetic method that uses electrodes with time-varying currents and voltages to map the variation of electrical permittivity (dielectric constant) in the Earth at low frequencies. Induced polarization is observed when a steady current through two electrodes in the Earth is shut off: the voltage does not return to zero instantaneously, but rather decays slowly, indicating that charge has been stored in the rocks. This charge, which accumulates mainly at interfaces between clay minerals, is responsible for the IP effect. This effect can be measured in either the time domain by observing the rate of decay of voltage or in the frequency domain by measuring phase shifts between sinusoidal currents and voltages. It is often used in exploration for minerals and can sometimes distinguish different types of mineralization. The IP method can probe to subsurface depths of thousands of meters.",induced polarization
Geology,"Structures formed by sediment injection. Because they resemble intrusive and extrusive igneous features, much of the vocabulary for describing injectites, or clastic intrusions, comes from igneous geology. Sills are emplaced parallel to bedding, whereas dikes cut through bedding. The strata containing the intrusion are called host strata and the layers that feed the intrusion are the parent beds. Sand-injection features exhibit size scales from millimeters to kilometers, and have been seen in cores, borehole image logs, seismic sections, outcrops, aerial photographs and satellite images.",injectite
Formation Evaluation,"Referring to a type of conventional electrical log in which the current-emitting and the current-return electrodes (A and B) are placed close together on the sonde, with the measure electrode (M) several feet away and the measure return (N) far away. This arrangement is sensitive to the potential gradient between A and B. The spacing is defined by the distance from M to the midpoint between A and B. The most common spacing is 18 ft, 8 in. [5.7 m]. The lateral gives a sharper response to a bed boundary than a normal but also introduces several artifacts that can give misleading results.",inverse
Reservoir Characterization,Mathematical techniques that require an algorithm or equation to be repeated until a condition is met. These methods usually require the convergence of a result to a value. Computers are excellent tools for performing iterative techniques quickly and efficiently.,iterative methods
Formation Evaluation,"Related to a wireline log of formation resistivity based on the principle of inducing alternating current loops in the formation and measuring the resultant signal in a receiver. In the simplest device, an alternating current of medium frequency (10?s of kHz) is passed through a transmitter coil, thereby inducing an alternating magnetic field in the formation. This field creates current loops in the formation. The loops produce their own magnetic field, which induce a current when they cross the receiver coil. This signal is proportional to the conductivity of the formation, with contributions from different regions of the formation summing approximately in conductivity. As a result, the induction log is most accurate at high conductivities and with resistive invasion. However, below about 1 ohm-m skin effect becomes important. Practical induction-logging tools use arrays of several coils, designed to achieve a specific focusing and depth of investigation. These arrays are either hardwired, such as the 6FF40, 5FF40 and others, or consist of several simple arrays that are combined in software (an array induction). For many years, the most common induction log was the 6FF40. This was often combined with the medium induction and a shallow laterolog or microresistivity log so as to correct for the effect of invasion, assuming a step profile. Induction logs also need borehole correction and shoulder-bed correction. In older tools, this was accomplished through multiple correction charts, while modern tools include software for this purpose. H.G. Doll introduced the first practical induction-logging technique in 1949. See Doll HG: Introduction to Induction logging and Application to Logging of Wells Drilled with Oil Base Mud Journal of Petroleum Technology 1, no. 6 (June 1949): 148-162.",induction
Formation Evaluation,"Another term for pseudogeometrical factor, the response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as: Jx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut) where Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).",J factor

Drilling,"A mechanical device used downhole to deliver an impact load to another downhole component, especially when that component is stuck. There are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. The principle is similar to that of a carpenter using a hammer. Kinetic energy is stored in the hammer as it is swung, and suddenly released to the nail and board when the hammer strikes the nail. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder, imparting an impact load. In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling.",jar

Larger, more complex jars for coiled tubing or workover strings incorporate a trip or firing mechanism that prevents the jar from operating until the desired tension is applied to the string, thus optimizing the impact delivered. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well.",jar

Drilling,"A small-diameter channel worn into the side of a larger diameter wellbore. This can be the result of a sharp change in direction of the wellbore (a dogleg), or if a hard formation ledge is left between softer formations that enlarge over time. In either case, the diameter of the channel is typically similar to the diameter of the drillpipe. When larger diameter drilling tools such as tool joints, drill collars, stabilizers, and bits are pulled into the channel, their larger diameters will not pass and the larger diameter tools may become stuck in the keyseat. Preventive measures include keeping any turns in the wellbore gradual and smooth. The remedy to keyseating involves enlarging the worn channel so that the larger diameter tools will fit through it.",keyseat
Drilling Fluids,"A mud with density high enough to produce a hydrostatic pressure at the point of influx in a wellbore that is sufficient to shut off flow into the well. Kill-weight mud, when needed, must be available quickly to avoid loss of control of the well or a blowout. Thus, it is usually made by weighting up some of the mud (link to ID 2107) in the system or in storage by adding barite or hematite. Unless diluted in advance, the mud may become too thick and perhaps un-pumpable due to high solids loading. A weight-up pilot test can identify if and how much dilution will be needed in advance of adding weighting material to the mud in the pits.",kill weight fluid

Drilling,"An adapter that serves to connect the rotary table to the kelly. The kelly bushing has an inside diameter profile that matches that of the kelly, usually square or hexagonal. It is connected to the rotary table by four large steel pins that fit into mating holes in the rotary table. The rotary motion from the rotary table is transmitted to the bushing through the pins, and then to the kelly itself through the square or hexagonal flat surfaces between the kelly and the kelly bushing. The kelly then turns the entire drillstring because it is screwed into the top of the drillstring itself. Depth measurements are commonly referenced to the KB, such as 8327 ft KB, meaning 8327 feet below the kelly bushing.",KB
Well Testing,"The product of formation permeability, k, and producing formation thickness, h, in a producing well, referred to as kh. This product is the primary finding of buildup and drawdown tests and is a key factor in the flow potential of a well. It is used for a large number of reservoir engineering calculations such as prediction of future performance, secondary and tertiary recovery potential, and potential success of well-stimulation procedures. Obtaining the best possible value of this product is the primary objective of transient well tests. To separate the elements of the product, it is necessary to have some independent measurement of one of them, usually the estimation of producing formation thickness from well logs. Permeability is then calculated, provided that the fluid formation volume factor and viscosity are known. The accuracy of the calculated permeability is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the estimated formation thickness and the fluid properties.",kh

Drilling,"A long square or hexagonal steel bar with a hole drilled through the middle for a fluid path. The kelly is used to transmit rotary motion from the rotary table or kelly bushing to the drillstring, while allowing the drillstring to be lowered or raised during rotation. The kelly goes through the kelly bushing, which is driven by the rotary table. The kelly bushing has an inside profile matching the kelly's outside profile (either square or hexagonal), but with slightly larger dimensions so that the kelly can freely move up and down inside.",kelly
Drilling,"A flow of formation fluids into the wellbore during drilling operations. The kick is physically caused by the pressure in the wellbore being less than that of the formation fluids, thus causing flow. This condition of lower wellbore pressure than the formation is caused in two ways. First, if the mud weight is too low, then the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the formation by the fluid column may be insufficient to hold the formation fluid in the formation. This can happen if the mud density is suddenly lightened or is not to specification to begin with, or if a drilled formation has a higher pressure than anticipated. This type of kick might be called an underbalanced kick. The second way a kick can occur is if dynamic and transient fluid pressure effects, usually due to motion of the drillstring or casing, effectively lower the pressure in the wellbore below that of the formation. This second kick type could be called an induced kick.",kick

The simultaneous lowering of the drillstring while pumping fluid is critical to the drilling operation.",kelly hose
Drilling,"To stop a well from flowing or having the ability to flow into the wellbore. Kill procedures typically involve circulating reservoir fluids out of the wellbore or pumping higher density mud into the wellbore, or both. In the case of an induced kick, where the mud density is sufficient to kill the well but the reservoir has flowed as a result of pipe movement, the driller must circulate the influx out of the wellbore. In the case of an underbalanced kick, the driller must circulate the influx out and increase the density of the drilling fluid. In the case of a producing well, a kill fluid with sufficient density to overcome production of formation fluid is pumped into the well to stop the flow of reservoir fluids.",kill
Geophysics,A mathematical representation of the principle that a wavefield at a given point in space and time can be considered as the superposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and earlier times.

Drilling,"A mechanical device for rotating the kelly. The kelly spinner is typically pneumatic. It is a relatively low torque device, useful only for the initial makeup of threaded tool joints. It is not strong enough for proper torque of the tool joint or for rotating the drillstring itself. The kelly spinner has largely replaced the infamous spinning chains, which were responsible for numerous injuries on the rig floor.",kelly spinner
Drilling,"A high-pressure pipe leading from an outlet on the BOP stack to the high-pressure rig pumps. During normal well control operations, kill fluid is pumped through the drillstring and annular fluid is taken out of the well through the choke line to the choke, which drops the fluid pressure to atmospheric pressure. If the drillpipe is inaccessible, it may be necessary to pump heavy drilling fluid in the top of the well, wait for the fluid to fall under the force of gravity, and then remove fluid from the annulus. In such an operation, while one high pressure line would suffice, it is more convenient to have two. In addition, this provides a measure of redundancy for the operation. In floating offshore operations, the choke and kill lines exit the subsea BOP stack and run along the outside of the riser to the surface. The volumetric and frictional effects of these long choke and kill lines must be taken into account to properly control the well.",kill line
Geophysics,"A method of seismic migration that uses the integral form (Kirchhoff equation) of the wave equation. All methods of seismic migration involve the backpropagation (or continuation) of the seismic wavefield from the region where it was measured (Earth's surface or along a borehole) into the region to be imaged. In Kirchhoff migration, this is done by using the Kirchhoff integral representation of a field at a given point as a (weighted) superposition of waves propagating from adjacent points and times. Continuation of the wavefield requires a background model of seismic velocity, which is usually a model of constant or smoothly varying velocity. Because of the integral form of Kirchhoff migration, its implementation reduces to stacking the data along curves that trace the arrival time of energy scattered by image points in the earth.",Kirchhoff migration

Drilling Fluids,"A mineral component of lignite, which is similar to brown coal. Lignite is found in surface deposits worldwide. Lignite is mined and put into piles where it can oxidize in the air before it is dried, ground and bagged for use in drilling fluids. The humic acid content of lignite, which varies widely, controls its solubility. The soluble and colloidal lignite components both help in fluid-loss control. Soluble components serve as clay deflocculants and improve filter cake quality. Colloidal lignite helps plug off the permeable parts of filter cake. When straight lignite is added to a mud, caustic soda is also needed to make it dissolve. Precaustisized lignite is available, which contains NaOH or KOH already mixed. Adding chromium salts improves high-temperature performance, but their use is limited by HSE concerns. Organophilic lignite is a straight lignite that has been treated with quaternary amine compounds to make it oil dispersible in oil- and synthetic-base muds.",leonardite
Formation Evaluation,"A technique for measuring the pore volume of a core sample from the difference in its weight when dry and when saturated with a liquid. A clean, dry sample is weighed and then evacuated for several hours in a vacuum chamber, flushing with CO2 to remove remaining air if necessary. A de-aerated liquid is introduced into the chamber and pressured to ensure complete saturation. The saturated sample is then weighed again. The difference in weight divided by the density of the liquid is the connected, or effective, pore volume. It is also common to measure the weight of the sample when immersed in the liquid. The grain and bulk volume can then be calculated as in the buoyancy method.",liquid saturation method

Formation Evaluation,"The electromagnetic force generated by a boundary between solutions of high salinity and low salinity. In a permeable formation, a liquid-junction potential is generated between the invaded zone and the undisturbed zone when the mud filtrate and the formation water have different salinities. This potential is one component of the electrochemical potential, from which the spontaneous potential log is derived. The other, much larger component is the membrane potential at a shale boundary. The liquid-junction potential is reduced if there is clay in the permeable formation, since this generates another, local membrane potential with the opposite polarity to the liquid-junction potential.",liquid junction potential
Formation Evaluation,"Log recorded by a sonic tool with a longer transmitter-to-receiver spacing (generally 10 to 15 ft) than a standard sonic tool. The rock near the borehole is sometimes altered by drilling fluids, stress relief, or both, causing a thin zone whose velocity is lower than that of the true formation. With standard spacings, the wave traveling through the altered zone may arrive first at the receiver, since this zone is closer to both transmitter and receiver. The increased spacing permits the wave traveling through the true formation to arrive first and be measured. The depth of investigation varies with slowness and transmitter-receiver spacing but is of the order of 2 to 3 ft. An increased transmitter-to-receiver spacing also allows better separation of waveforms relating to different acoustic waves, such as compressional, shear and Stoneley arrivals.",long spacing sonic log

Production Logging,"A type of streamlined flow for single-phase fluids in which the fluid moves in parallel layers, or laminae. The layers flow smoothly over each other with instabilities being dampened by the viscosity. Laminar flow occurs in straight pipes when the Reynolds number is below a critical value, corresponding to a low production rate. Above this value, the flow is turbulent. For laminar flow in straight pipes, the velocity profile across the pipe is parabolic, increasing from zero at the wall of the pipe to a maximum at the center equal to twice the mean velocity.",laminar flow

Drilling,"The reduced or total absence of fluid flow up the annulus when fluid is pumped through the drillstring. Though the definitions of different operators vary, this reduction of flow may generally be classified as seepage (less than 20 bbl/hr [3 m3/hr]), partial lost returns (greater than 20 bbl/hr [3 m3/hr] but still some returns), and total lost returns (where no fluid comes out of the annulus). In this severe latter case, the hole may not remain full of fluid even if the pumps are turned off. If the hole does not remain full of fluid, the vertical height of the fluid column is reduced and the pressure exerted on the open formations is reduced. This in turn can result in another zone flowing into the wellbore, while the loss zone is taking mud, or even a catastrophic loss of well control. Even in the two less severe forms, the loss of fluid to the formation represents a financial loss that must be dealt with, and the impact of which is directly tied to the per barrel cost of the drilling fluid and the loss rate over time.",lost circulation
Drilling Fluids,"A lack of mud returning to the surface after being pumped down a well. Lost circulation occurs when the drill bit encounters natural fissures, fractures or caverns, and mud flows into the newly available space.

Drilling,"Abbreviation for leakoff test, a test to determine the strength or fracture pressure of the open formation, usually conducted immediately after drilling below a new casing shoe. During the test, the well is shut in and fluid is pumped into the wellbore to gradually increase the pressure that the formation experiences. At some pressure, fluid will enter the formation, or leak off, either moving through permeable paths in the rock or by creating a space by fracturing the rock.

Drilling Fluids,"A type of coal. Lignite is found in surface deposits worldwide. Lignite is mined and put into piles where it can oxidize in the air before it is dried, ground and bagged for use in drilling fluids. The humic acid content of lignite, which varies widely, controls its solubility. The soluble and colloidal lignite components both help in fluid-loss control. Soluble components serve as clay deflocculants and improve filter cake quality. Colloidal lignite helps plug off the permeable parts of filter cake. When straight lignite is added to a mud, caustic soda is also needed to make it dissolve. Precaustisized lignite is available, which contains NaOH or KOH already mixed. Adding chromium salts improves high-temperature performance, but their use is limited by HSE concerns. Organophilic lignite is a straight lignite that has been treated with quaternary amine compounds to make it oil dispersible in oil- and synthetic-base muds.",lignite

Sometimes it is called sulfonated lignin. Lignosulfonate is a complex mixture of small- to moderate-sized polymeric compounds with sulfonate groups attached to the molecule. LS became a popular deflocculant in the late 1950s as a replacement for quebracho. Chromium and iron compounds were admixed to get stability benefits at higher temperature. These were called chrome lignosulfonates (CLS) and ferro-chrome lignosulfonates (FCLS).

Drilling Fluids,"A type of water-base mud that is saturated with lime, Ca(OH)2, and has excess, undissolved lime solids maintained in reserve. Lime muds are classified according to excess lime content: (1) low-lime, 0.5 to 2 lbm/bbl, (2) medium-lime, 2 to 4 lbm/bbl and (3) high-lime, over 4 lbm/bbl. All lime muds have pH in the range of 12, and the filtrate is saturated with lime. Fluid-loss additives include starch, HP-starch, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or polyanionic cellulose (PAC). Prehydrated bentonite can improve the fluid loss and rheology of a lime mud. A maltodextrin in lime muds has been used as a clay deflocculant, a shale stabilizer and to increase calcium solubility. KCl in lime muds has been another innovation for successful drilling of hydratable shales. The ability to carry very high mud alkalinity (as excess lime) to neutralize acid gases is one reason lime muds are used. H2S zones can be drilled with more safety and copious amounts of CO2 can be neutralized by a large excess of lime.",lime mud

Limited-entry completions in vertical wells are designed to avoid unwanted fluid production, such as gas from an overlying gas cap or water from an underlying aquifer. The effects of limited entry may be seen in perforated and gravel-packed wells when some of the perforations fail to clean up. This is also called a partial completion. The limited entry also results from partial penetration, which occurs when the productive formation is only partly drilled. This partial penetration represents a near-well flow restriction that results in a positive skin effect in a well-test analysis.",limited entry
Well Workover and Intervention,"Oil pumped into a wellbore in preparation for, or as part of, a treatment. Some treatments, such as hydraulic fracturing, involve pumping large volumes of fluid.

Production Logging,"A small sensor, part of a production logging tool, which determines the type of fluid in its vicinity as it moves up and down a production well. Typically there are four or more sensors, or probes, held on arms to measure the four quadrants of the well cross-section. The probes may be electrical, to distinguish hydrocarbon from water; optical, mainly to distinguish gas from liquid, but also oil from water; or dielectric, mainly to distinguish water from hydrocarbon, but also, with less resolution, oil from gas. They can detect bubbles that are larger than about 1 mm diameter. Their response is essentially digital, indicating either one fluid or the other, so that the percentage of time that they see a fluid is a direct measure of its holdup. The rate of change between the two fluids is known as the bubble count. The results can be averaged to give the mean holdup and bubble count, or converted into an image, showing the holdup or bubble count at different locations across the well at different depths.

Drilling,"A casing string that does not extend to the top of the wellbore, but instead is anchored or suspended from inside the bottom of the previous casing string. There is no difference between the casing joints themselves. The advantage to the well designer of a liner is a substantial savings in steel, and therefore capital costs. To save casing, however, additional tools and risk are involved. The well designer must trade off the additional tools, complexities and risks against the potential capital savings when deciding whether to design for a liner or a casing string that goes all the way to the top of the well (a long string). The liner can be fitted with special components so that it can be connected to the surface at a later time if need be.",liner
Well Completions,"Any string of casing in which the top does not extend to the surface but instead is suspended from inside the previous casing string.

Reservoir Characterization," Formation Evaluation, Drilling,To continuously measure formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include electrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies), sonic properties, active and passive nuclear measurements, dimensional measurements of the wellbore, formation fluid sampling, formation pressure measurement, wireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools, and others. For wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string (link to ID 2964) has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, down log measurements might be conducted on the way into the well, and repeated on the way out if possible.) Most wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.",log
Formation Evaluation,"The measurement versus depth or time, or both, of one or more physical quantities in or around a well. The term comes from the word log used in the sense of a record or a note. Wireline logs are taken downhole, transmitted through a wireline to surface and recorded there. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD) logs are also taken downhole. They are either transmitted to surface by mud pulses, or else recorded downhole and retrieved later when the instrument is brought to surface. Mud logs that describe samples of drilled cuttings are taken and recorded on surface.",log

Production Testing,"The determination of the location of a leak in a pipeline. In onshore operations, this can be done by external detection or by using material balance leak-detection systems. In offshore operations, the task is more difficult because of the lack of inlet flow-rate measurements and the considerable solubility of natural gas in seawater at high pressures and low temperatures (seafloor level). In deepwater operations with multiphase flow, indications of a leak may not be present at the ocean surface or it could be considerably displaced from the site of origination. In these circumstances, an energy-balance technique based on the changes in frictional losses through the pipeline is a powerful tool.",leak detection

During the test, a real-time plot of injected fluid versus fluid pressure is plotted. The initial stable portion of this plot for most wellbores is a straight line, within the limits of the measurements. The leakoff is the point of permanent deflection from that straight portion.

The top of the lubricator assembly includes a high-pressure grease-injection section and sealing elements. The lubricator is installed on top of the tree and tested, the tools placed in the lubricator and the lubricator pressurized to wellbore pressure. Then the top valves of the tree are opened to enable the tools to fall or be pumped into the wellbore under pressure. To remove the tools, the reverse process is used: the tools are pulled up into the lubricator under wellbore pressure, the tree valves are closed, the lubricator pressure is bled off, and then the lubricator may be opened to remove the tools.",lubricator
Well Workover and Intervention,A term initially applied to the assembly of pressure-control equipment used on slickline operations to house the tool string in preparation for running into the well or for retrieval of the tool string on completion of the operation.

Drilling,"A test to determine the strength or fracture pressure of the open formation, usually conducted immediately after drilling below a new casing shoe. During the test, the well is shut in and fluid is pumped into the wellbore to gradually increase the pressure that the formation experiences. At some pressure, fluid will enter the formation, or leak off, either moving through permeable paths in the rock or by creating a space by fracturing the rock. The results of the leakoff test dictate the maximum pressure or mud weight that may be applied to the well during drilling operations. To maintain a small safety factor to permit safe well control operations, the maximum operating pressure is usually slightly below the leakoff test result.",leakoff test

Wireline logging tools are typically cylinders from 1.5 to 5 in. [3.8 to 12.7 cm] in diameter. Since the total length is more than can be conveniently handled in one piece, the logging tool is divided into different sections that are assembled at the wellsite. These sections consist of cartridges and sondes. Different measurements can be combined to make up a tool string. The total length of a tool string may range from 10 to 100 ft [3 to 30 m] or more. Flexible joints are added in long tool strings to ease passage in the borehole, and to allow different sections to be centralized or eccentralized. If the total length is very long, it is often preferable to make two or more logging runs with shorter tool strings.",logging tool
Drilling Fluids,A measure of the degree of lubrication.,lubricity
Formation Evaluation,"A type of acoustic energy that propagates in one direction while being confined in the other two directions, in this case by the borehole wall. Leaky modes can be considered as multiply reflected and constructively interfering waves propagating in the borehole. Each time a compressional wave hits the borehole wall, part of the energy is reflected into the borehole, while the rest is converted to compressional or shear energy that radiates into the formation, hence the term 'leaky'. Leaky modes are dispersive, starting at a certain cutoff frequency with the formation compressional velocity and increasing towards the borehole fluid velocity at high frequency. In slow formations, where no head wave is generated because the borehole fluid is faster than the formation compressional wave, the low-frequency end of the leaky mode can be used to determine formation compressional velocity. The term 'hybrid mode' is used to describe a form of leaky mode that is associated with an altered zone.",leaky mode

Well Completions," Well Workover and Intervention,A mixture of hydrofluoric acid [HF] and hydrochloric acid [HCl] or organic acid used as the main fluid in a sandstone matrix treatment. Hydrochloric acid or organic acid is mixed with HF to keep the pH low when it spends, thereby preventing detrimental precipitates. The name mud acid was given to these mixtures because they were originally developed to treat damage from siliceous drilling muds. Mud acid is also called hydrofluoric-hydrochloric acid.",mud acid
Drilling Fluids,"A measure of the total amount of hydroxyl ions in a solution as determined by titration with standardized acid and methyl orange indicator. The alkalinity test is a well-known water-analysis procedure to estimate hydroxyl ion, carbonate ion and bicarbonate ion concentrations. There are two pH endpoints, P and M, in this titration, corresponding to phenolphthalein and methyl orange indicators. The P endpoint is at pH 8.3 and the M endpoint is at pH 4.3. Each is reported in units of cm3 acid/cm3 sample. Mf therefore represents the amount of acid required, per unit volume of the sample, to reduce the pH to 4.3. For water samples and very simple mud filtrates, P and M data indicate OH-, HCO3- and CO3-2 concentrations, but an alkalinity test is unreliable for analyzing complex mud filtrates. The API has established standards for conducting alkalinity tests.",Mf
Drilling,"The evaluation of physical properties, usually including pressure, temperature and wellbore trajectory in three-dimensional space, while extending a wellbore. MWD is now standard practice in offshore directional wells, where the tool cost is offset by rig time and wellbore stability considerations if other tools are used. The measurements are made downhole, stored in solid-state memory for some time and later transmitted to the surface. Data transmission methods vary from company to company, but usually involve digitally encoding data and transmitting to the surface as pressure pulses in the mud system. These pressures may be positive, negative or continuous sine waves. Some MWD tools have the ability to store the measurements for later retrieval with wireline or when the tool is tripped out of the hole if the data transmission link fails. MWD tools that measure formation parameters (resistivity, porosity, sonic velocity, gamma ray) are referred to as logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools. LWD tools use similar data storage and transmission systems, with some having more solid-state memory to provide higher resolution logs after the tool is tripped out than is possible with the relatively low bandwidth, mud-pulse data transmission system.",measurements while drilling

Production Logging,"A distortion of the magnetic flux that has been introduced into a casing by a low-frequency electromagnet or permanent magnet. The principle of flux leakage is used to detect casing corrosion, since flux leakage is caused by rapid changes in the thickness of the casing and by pits and holes in either the internal or external wall. Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall. The results are often combined with a high-frequency, eddy-current measurement, designed to detect flaws only on the inner wall.",magnetic flux leakage

Weight is reported in lbm/gal (also known as ppg), kg/m3 or g/cm3 (also called specific gravity or SG), lb/ft3 or in hydrostatic gradient, lb/in2/ft (psi/ft) or pptf (psi/1000 ft). Mud weight controls hydrostatic pressure in a wellbore and prevents unwanted flow into the well. The weight of the mud also prevents collapse of casing and the openhole. Excessive mud weight can cause lost circulation by propagating, and then filling, fractures in the rock. Mud weight (density) test procedures using a mud balance have been standardized and published by the API.",mud density

Formation Evaluation,"The electromagnetic force generated across an ion-selective membrane when solutions on either side of the membrane have different salinities. Shales and clays are cationic membranes, since they allow the passage of cations, such as Na+, but not anions, such as Cl-. When the drilling mud in the borehole and the formation water have different salinities, a membrane potential is generated at the boundary between a shale and a permeable formation. This potential is one component of the electrochemical potential, from which the spontaneous potential (SP) log is derived. The other, much smaller component is the liquid-junction potential. The membrane potential is reduced if the shale is not a good cationic membrane, or in other words has a low cation-exchange capacity. A membrane potential may also be generated across the mudcake if there is no flushed zone; for example if the mud filtrate has moved vertically since invasion took place, and by clay within a shaly sand, but with the opposite polarity to the normal SP potentials. The membrane potential is also used in core analysis to determine the cation-exchange capacity of a sample. In this case, the clay within the sample is the ion-selective membrane, and the potential generated across it is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit pore volume, Qv. As a method of measuring Qv, the technique is faster than the multiple salinity method, and more representative of the in-situ value than destructive methods such as conductometric titration. However, care is needed in making the measurement and deriving the appropriate Qv.",membrane potential
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A general term for injection processes that introduce miscible gases into the reservoir. A miscible displacement process maintains reservoir pressure and improves oil displacement because the interfacial tension between oil and water is reduced. The effect of gas injection is similar to that of a solution gasdrive. Miscible displacement is a major branch of enhanced oil recovery processes. Injected gases include liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), such as propane, methane under high pressure, methane enriched with light hydrocarbons, nitrogen under high pressure, and carbon dioxide [CO2] under suitable reservoir conditions of temperature and pressure. The fluid most commonly used for miscible displacement is carbon dioxide because it reduces the oil viscosity and is less expensive than liquefied petroleum gas.

Oceanic basalts record the Earth's magnetic field as they solidify from molten lava symmetrically on each side of the midoceanic ridges.

Geophysics,"An electromagnetic method used to map the spatial variation of the Earth's resistivity by measuring naturally occurring electric and magnetic fields at the Earth's surface. These natural EM fields are generated (at all frequencies) in the Earth's atmosphere mainly by lightning strokes and by interactions between the solar wind and the ionosphere. In the most general MT method, the horizontal components of the electric field and all three components of the magnetic field are measured at the surface. The measurements are used to determine specific ratios of electric to magnetic field components called tensor impedances. The technique was introduced the French geophysicist Louis Cagniard in the 1950s and has been popular for mineral exploration and regional geophysical mapping. It is used in oil exploration for low-cost reconnaissance of sedimentary basins and for exploration in areas where seismic surveys are difficult because of severe topography or the presence high-impedance volcanic rocks near the surface.

Geophysics,"Earth’s main magnetic field generated in the Earth’s fluid outer core by a self-exciting dynamo process. Approximately 95% of the total magnetic field measured at Earth’s surface comes from this main field, a significant portion of which may be described as the field of a dipole placed at the Earth’s center and tilted approximately 11° from the Earth’s rotational axis. The magnitude of the main magnetic field is nearly 60,000 nT near the Earth’s poles and about 30,000 nT near the equator. However, there are significant nondipole contributions to the main magnetic field that complicate its mathematical and graphical representation, including that the relative strengths of nondipole components change.

The texture of metamorphic rocks can vary from almost homogeneous, or nonfoliated, to foliated rocks with a strong planar fabric or foliation produced by alignment of minerals during recrystallization or by reorientation. Common foliated metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and slate. Marble, or metamorphosed limestone, can be foliated or non-foliated. Hornfels is a nonfoliated metamorphic rock. Graphite, chlorite, talc, mica, garnet and staurolite are distinctive metamorphic minerals.",metamorphic
Drilling Fluids,"mixed-metal hydroxide 1. n. [Drilling Fluids] ID: 2102 A compound containing hydroxide anions in association with two or more metal cations. MMH particles are extremely small and carry multiple positive charges. They can associate with bentonite to form a strong complex that exhibits highly shear-thinning properties, with high and fragile gel strengths, high yield point (YP), and low plastic viscosity (PV). MMH is described as a mixed-metal layered hydroxide (MMLH). In the crystal layers, Al+3 , Mg+2 and OH- ions reside, but due to symmetry considerations, there is not enough room for sufficient OH- ions to electrically offset the charges of the two cations. Therefore, a net positive charge exists on the crystal surfaces. Exchangeable anions sit on the positive surface (much the same as cations sit on negative clay surfaces). MMH muds are used as nondamaging drilling fluids, metal-reaming fluids (to carry out metal cuttings) and for wellbore shale control. Being cationic, MMH mud is sensitive to anionic deflocculants and small anionic polymers, such as polyphosphates, lignosulfonate or lignite.

Drilling,"To add a length of drillpipe to the drillstring to continue drilling. In what is called jointed pipe drilling, joints of drillpipe, each about 30 ft [9 m] long, are screwed together as the well is drilled. When the bit on the bottom of the drillstring has drilled down to where the kelly or topdrive at the top of the drillstring nears the drillfloor, the drillstring between the two must be lengthened by adding a joint or a stand (usually three joints) to the drillstring. Once the rig crew is ready, the driller stops the rotary, picks up off bottom to expose a threaded connection below the kelly and turns the pumps off. The crew sets the slips to grip the drillstring temporarily, unscrews that threaded connection and screws the kelly (or topdrive) into the additional joint (or stand) of pipe. The driller picks that joint or stand up to allow the crew to screw the bottom of that pipe into the top of the temporarily hanging drillstring. The driller then picks up the entire drillstring to remove the slips, carefully lowers the drillstring while starting the pumps and rotary, and resumes drilling when the bit touches bottom. A skilled rig crew can physically accomplish all of those steps in a minute or two.",make a connection

Drilling,"An adaptive drilling method used to precisely control the annular pressure throughout a wellbore. After determining the downhole pressure environment, drillers manage wellbore pressure constrained by the limits of formation properties. The annular pressure is kept slightly above the pore pressure to prevent the influx of formation fluids into the wellbore, but it is maintained well below the fracture initiation pressure. Rapid corrective actions can often be implemented in order to deal with observed pressure variations. The MPD process may utilize a variety of techniques including control of back pressure, adjusting mud density, modifying fluid rheology, adjusting the annular fluid level, controlling circulating friction and incorporating hole geometry in the well construction. The use of MPD to control the risks and costs of drilling wells that have narrow downhole pressure limits by actively managing the wellbore pressure profile has become a common practice. The dynamic control of annular pressures enables drilling wells that might not otherwise be practical.",managed pressure drilling

Drilling Fluids,"A crystalline solid consisting of water with methane molecules in an ice-like cage structure. The general term for this type of solid is clathrate. Water molecules form a lattice structure into which many types of gas molecules can fit. Most gases, except hydrogen and helium, can form hydrates. C1 to nC5 hydrocarbons, H2S and CO2 readily form hydrates at low temperature and high pressure. Heavier hydrocarbons may also enter the structure but do not form hydrates by themselves. Gas-cut muds can form hydrates in deepwater drilling operations, plugging BOP lines, risers and subsea wellheads, causing a well-control risk. Gas hydrates are thermodynamically suppressed by adding antifreeze materials such as salts or glycols. A common practice is to use 20 to 23 wt.% NaCl. Nucleation and growth of hydrates can be dynamically inhibited by certain polymers or surfactants. Gas hydrates are found in nature, on the bottom of cold seas and in arctic permafrost regions. Drilling into these can be hazardous, but they offer another source of hydrocarbons for future exploitation.

Drilling Fluids," Formation Evaluation,The residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.",mudcake

Geophysics,"Seismic data acquired in a land, marine, or borehole environment by using more than one geophone or accelerometer. 3C seismic data, a type of multicomponent seismic data, uses three orthogonally oriented geophones or accelerometers. 4C seismic data, another type of multicomponent seismic data, involves the addition of a hydrophone to three orthogonally oriented geophones or accelerometers. 3C multicomponent seismic data is particularly appropriate when the addition of a hydrophone (the basis for 4C seismic data) adds no value to the measurement, for example, on land. This technique allows determination of both the type of wave and its direction of propagation.",multicomponent seismic data

Well Completions,"A small gap that can form between the casing or liner and the surrounding cement sheath, most commonly formed by variations in temperature or pressure during or after the cementing process. Such variations cause small movement of the steel casing, breaking the cement bond and creating a microannulus that is typically partial. However, in severe cases the microannulus may encircle the entire casing circumference. A microannulus can jeopardize the hydraulic efficiency of a primary cementing operation, allowing communication between zones if it is severe and connected.",microannulus
Geophysics,"Another term for shear modulus, an elastic constant for the ratio of shear stress to shear strain. The shear modulus is one of the Lamé constants.

The microorganism can either be injected into the reservoir, or the population of an existing microorganism in the reservoir can be enhanced by injection of nutrients preferred by that microorganism. The microorganisms improve oil recovery by various means: (1) by releasing gases and increasing the pressure of the reservoir; (2) by breaking the heavier molecules into smaller chain components, resulting in the reduction of viscosity of oil; and 3) by producing natural surfactants that can improve oil flow by altering the interfacial properties of the system comprising the crude oil, brine and rock.",microbial enhanced oil recovery

Production Logging,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using several logging runs of the flowmeter over the zone of interest at different speeds, both up and down. Spinner speed is a nearly linear function of the effective velocity of the fluid. Although this function can be measured on surface, it varies with the fluid and is most reliably determined in situ. After several passes are made, the function can be calibrated and the spinner speed converted into flow rate. The technique is applicable when the flow is single phase, or else multiphase with a sufficiently homogeneous flow regime such as with emulsion or dispersed bubble flow.",multipass method
Drilling Fluids,"A conical-shaped funnel, fitted with a small-bore tube on the bottom end through which mud flows under a gravity head. A screen over the top removes large particles that might plug the tube. In the test standardized by API for evaluating water-base and oil-base muds, the funnel viscosity measurement is the time (in seconds) required for one quart of mud to flow out of a Marsh funnel into a graduated mud cup. Funnel viscosity is reported in seconds (for a quart). Water exits the funnel in about 26 seconds. This test was one of the earliest mud measurements for field use. Simple, quick and fool-proof, it still serves as a useful indicator of change in the mud by comparing mud-in and mud-out sample funnel viscosities. Hallan N. Marsh of Los Angeles published the design and use of his funnel viscometer in 1931, and it is worth the time to read the detailed, often humorous, discussion that followed. Mr. Marsh was a forward thinking mud technologist in his day, as can be seen from the following words from his 1931 AIME paper: The subject of mud sounds so simple, uninteresting and unimportant that it has failed to receive the attention that it deserves, at least as applied to the drilling of oil wells. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most complicated, technical, important and interesting subjects in connection with rotary drilling. Mr. Marsh was quoted by someone who knew him as saying (paraphrased), Of all the things I have done in mud technology, I am remembered for inventing this d*** funnel.Reference:Marsh H: Properties and Treatment of Rotary Mud, Petroleum Development and Technology, Transactions of the AIME (1931): 234-251.",Marsh funnel

Assumptions are: (1) masses and volumes of components are additive and (2) material is neither generated nor lost from the system. As a simple example, below are the two material-balance equations for a three-component mixture of oil (o), water (w) and solids (s), where V = volume percent, D = specific density and MW = mixture weight. (This could represent a simple, weighted oil-base mud formulation.)MW = DsVs + DoVo + DwVw100% = Vs + Vo + Vw.By solving these equations simultaneously, an unknown parameter can be found if other parameters are known or can be estimated accurately. Material-balance equations are used to derive formulations of muds, to calculate the amount of barite needed to weight-up a mud, to determine the amount of water needed to dilute a mud, and to find the volume of two or more muds to mix together to achieve a new mud weight and volume.

The typical microlog has one current-emitting electrode and two measure electrodes in line above it, one at 1 in. [2.5 cm], the other at 2 in. [5 cm]. The potential at the 2-in. electrode gives a 2-in. micronormal log. The difference in potential between the two measure electrodes gives a 1-in. x 1-in. microinverse log. The micronormal reads deeper than the microinverse. Introduced in 1948, the microlog is used to detect permeable zones across which a mudcake has formed. Since the mudcake is usually less resistive than the invaded zone, the microinverse will read less than the micronormal opposite permeable zones. If the resistivity and thickness of the mudcake are known, it is possible to estimate the resistivity of the flushed zone. The log is usually presented on a linear scale, chosen to emphasize the lower readings often seen opposite permeable zones with mudcake.",microlog

The technique is used mainly in deviated and horizontal wells, where the complex flow regimes cause conventional holdup measurements to be inaccurate. The pulsed-neutron spectroscopy measurement is processed to obtain the volume of oil in the borehole rather than the oil in the formation as in a conventional carbon-oxygen measurement. The gas holdup is determined from the ratio of counts received by the near and far detectors in either the inelastic or capture mode, a technique similar to the compensated-neutron log. The water holdup is the remaining fraction. Alternatively, the capture cross section of the borehole can be determined from the pulsed-neutron capture measurement. If the water is saline, and its salinity is known, the water holdup can be determined directly.",multiphase holdup log

A multiphase meter provides accurate readings even when different flow regimes are present in the multiphase flow. When using single-phase meters, the fluid mixture (oil and gas) coming from the wellbore must pass through a fluid-separation stage (separator) prior metering. Otherwise, the readings of the single-phase meters will be inaccurate. Separators are not necessary for multiphase metering, and the meters can support different proportions of gas and oil. Multiphase meters provide the advantage of continuous well monitoring, which is not possible using single-phase meters. Additionally, multiphase meters cost less, weigh less and require less space. Multiphase meters are more common in deepwater operations, where well-intervention operations are often prohibitively expensive.",multiphase meter

Additionally, since the surface equipment, including separators, heater-treaters, dehydrators and pipes, is reduced, the impact on the environment is also reduced.

Well Workover and Intervention," Well Completions,A treatment designed to treat the near-wellbore reservoir formation rather than other areas of the production conduit, such as the casing across the production interval, production tubulars or the perforations. Matrix stimulation treatments include acid, solvent and chemical treatments to improve the permeability of the near-wellbore formation, enhancing the productivity of a well. Matrix stimulation is a process of injecting a fluid into the formation, either an acid or solvent at pressures below the fracturing pressure, to improve the production or injection flow capacity of a well. The goal of a matrix treatment is different in sandstones than in carbonates. In sandstones, matrix treatments restore or improve the natural formation permeability around the wellbore by removing formation damage, by dissolving material plugging the pores or by enlarging the pore spaces. In carbonates, matrix stimulation creates new, highly conductive channels (wormholes) that bypass damage. Because of these differences, the selection criteria for the treating fluid are also distinct. For sandstone treatments, knowledge of the extent, type of damage, location, origin, reservoir mineralogy (petrographic study) and compatibility of the treating fluid with the formation are especially important. In carbonate treatments, reservoir temperature, pumping rate and fluid type become more significant because these parameters directly affect the reactivity of the treating fluid with the reservoir rock. A sandstone matrix stimulation treatment is generally composed of a hydrochloric acid [HCl] preflush, a main treating fluid (HCl-HF mixtures) and an overflush (weak acid solution or brine). The treating fluid is maintained under pressure inside the reservoir for a period of time, after which the well is swabbed and returned to production. In carbonate reservoirs, HCl is the most common fluid used. Organic acids such as formic and acetic acid are used in either sandstone or carbonate acidizing, mainly in retarded-acid systems or in high-temperature applications. Matrix stimulation is also called matrix treatment or matrix acidizing.",matrix stimulation

Geology,"The state of a source rock with respect to its ability to generate oil or gas. As a source rock begins to mature, it generates gas. As an oil-prone source rock matures, the generation of heavy oils is succeeded by medium and light oils. Above a temperature of approximately 100 oC [212 oF], only dry gas is generated, and incipient metamorphism is imminent. The maturity of a source rock reflects the ambient pressure and temperature as well as the duration of conditions favorable for hydrocarbon generation.",maturity
Geology,"The movement of hydrocarbons from their source into reservoir rocks. The movement of newly generated hydrocarbons out of their source rock is primary migration, also called expulsion. The further movement of the hydrocarbons into reservoir rock in a hydrocarbon trap or other area of accumulation is secondary migration. Migration typically occurs from a structurally low area to a higher area because of the relative buoyancy of hydrocarbons in comparison to the surrounding rock. Migration can be local or can occur along distances of hundreds of kilometers in large sedimentary basins, and is critical to the formation of a viable petroleum system.",migration
Geophysics,"A step in seismic processing in which reflections in seismic data are moved to their correct locations in the x-y-time space of seismic data, including two-way traveltime and position relative to shotpoints. Migration improves seismic interpretation and mapping because the locations of geological structures, especially faults, are more accurate in migrated seismic data. Proper migration collapses diffractions from secondary sources such as reflector terminations against faults and corrects bow ties to form synclines. There are numerous methods of migration, such as dip moveout (DMO), frequency domain, ray-trace and wave-equation migration.",migration

The mousehole is usually fitted underneath with a length of casing, usually with a bottom. A joint of drillpipe that will be used next in the drilling operation is placed in the mousehole, box end up, by the rig crew at a convenient time (immediately after the previous connection is made). When the bit drills down and the kelly is near the rotary table, another piece of drillpipe must be added for drilling to continue. This next piece of pipe is standing in the mousehole when the kelly is screwed onto it. Then the kelly and the joint of pipe in the mousehole are raised to remove the pipe from the mousehole, the mousehole pipe screwed onto the rest of the drillstring, and the drillstring lowered, rotated, and pumped through to continue drilling. Another piece of pipe is put in the mousehole to await the next connection.",mousehole

The surface also marks the deepest water facies within a sequence. The maximum flooding surface represents a change from retrogradational to progradational parasequence stacking patterns. It commonly displays evidence of condensation or slow deposition, such as abundant burrowing, hardgrounds, mineralization and fossil accumulations. On wireline logs, the shales that immediately overlie the maximum flooding surface commonly have different characteristics than other shales and can often be recognized on the basis of resistivity, gamma ray, neutron and density logs. These shales can also be recognized by electrofacies analysis when the analysis is designed to do so.",maximum flooding surface

Well Workover and Intervention," Drilling,A tool that grinds metal downhole. A mill is usually used to remove junk in the hole or to grind away all or part of a casing string. In the case of junk, the metal must be broken into smaller pieces to facilitate removal from the wellbore so that drilling can continue. When milling casing, the intent is to cut a window through the side of the casing or to remove a continuous section of the casing so that the wellbore may be deviated from the original well through the window or section removed.

Data transmission methods vary from company to company, but usually involve digitally encoding data and transmitting to the surface as pressure pulses in the mud system. These pressures may be positive, negative or continuous sine waves. Some MWD tools have the ability to store the measurements for later retrieval with wireline or when the tool is tripped out of the hole if the data transmission link fails. MWD tools that measure formation parameters (resistivity, porosity, sonic velocity, gamma ray) are referred to as logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools.

Geophysics,"An electromagnetic method used to map the spatial variation of the Earth's resistivity by measuring naturally occurring electric and magnetic fields at the Earth's surface. These natural EM fields are generated (at all frequencies) in the Earth's atmosphere mainly by lightning strokes and by interactions between the solar wind and the ionosphere. In the most general MT method, the horizontal components of the electric field and all three components of the magnetic field are measured at the surface. The measurements are used to determine specific ratios of electric to magnetic field components called tensor impedances. The technique was introduced the French geophysicist Louis Cagniard in the 1950s and has been popular for mineral exploration and regional geophysical mapping. It is used in oil exploration for low-cost reconnaissance of sedimentary basins and for exploration in areas where seismic surveys are difficult because of severe topography or the presence high-impedance volcanic rocks near the surface. The resolution of MT surveys is limited by the diffusive nature of EM propagation in the earth; it is usually on the order of hundreds of meters to kilometers. But the MT method can probe the Earth to depths of several tens of kilometers.",MT

Formation Evaluation,"The exponent, n, in the relation of water saturation, Sw, to resistivity index, I (I = Sw-n) for a sample of rock. It expresses the effect on the resistivity of desaturating the sample, or replacing water with a non-conductive fluid. In petrophysically simple, water-wet rocks (Archie rocks), n is constant for different values of Sw, and a single average n can be found for a particular reservoir or formation. A typical value is 2. In more complex rocks, n changes with Sw, although often being about 2 near Sw = 1. In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, n becomes increasingly lower as Sw is reduced. This change is negligible for high-salinity waters, but increases as the salinity is reduced. In shaly-sand saturation equations, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS and CRMM, n is the intrinsic n, determined with high-salinity water or with the clay effects removed. The variation of I with Sw is then predicted, with varying success, by the different equations. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, n may change as each pore type is desaturated. A different n may be used for a different range of Sw. In all cases, n increases if any pores are oil-wet. Values up to 8 have been reported in very oil-wet rocks.",n

Drilling Fluids,"Not a typical fluid. Unlike a Newtonian fluid, which displays liquid behavior, a non-Newtonian fluid has properties of a liquid and of a solid. Under certain conditions, a non-Newtonian fluid flows as a liquid and under other conditions, it exhibits elasticity, plasticity and strength similar to a solid. In addition, unlike Newtonian fluids, the viscosity of many non-Newtonian fluids varies with shear rate. Four classes of non-Newtonian fluids depend on how the fluid viscosity—a measure of a fluid’s ability to resist flow—varies in response to the duration and magnitude of applied shear rate. The viscosity of: Thixotropic fluids decreases over time under shearing. For example, solid honey becomes a liquid after continuous stirring. Rheopectic fluids increases over time under shearing. For example, cream will thicken after continuous stirring. Pseudoplastic fluids decreases with increasing shear rate; these fluids exhibit shear thinning behavior. For example, ketchup will squirt through a hole in a bottle top at high velocity but stand still as a dollop on a plate. Dilatant fluids increases with increasing shear rate; these fluids exhibit shear thickening behavior. Most successful drilling fluids are non-Newtonian and exhibit behaviors that are described by rheological mathematical models of shear stress, or resistance, as a function of shear rate. In the Bingham plastic model, flow will not begin until the shear stress attains a minimum value, the yield stress, after which the flow is similar to that of a Newtonian fluid because the viscosity is constant and does not vary with shear rate. Pseudoplasticity, or shear thinning, is a non-Newtonian behavior that is desirable for drilling fluids. Power-law and Herschel-Bulkley models describe pseudoplastic behavior, in which the slope—the viscosity—of the shear stress versus shear rate curve decreases as the shear rate decreases.",non Newtonian fluid

Shale Gas," Geology,A crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow. Fractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.",natural fracture

There are three sources of natural radioactivity in the Earth: 40K, 232Th and 238U, or potassium, thorium and uranium. These radioactive isotopes emit gamma rays that have characteristic energy levels. The quantity and energy of these gamma rays can be measured in a scintillation detector. A log of natural gamma ray spectroscopy is usually presented as a total gamma ray log and the weight fraction of potassium (%), thorium (ppm) and uranium (ppm).

Production Logging,"A record of elemental concentrations derived from the characteristic energy levels of gamma rays emitted by a nucleus that has been activated by neutron bombardment. In the context of production logging, the term normally refers to the activation of silicon and aluminum to determine the quality of a gravel pack. Silicon and aluminum are activated by a neutron source to produce isotopes that decay with a half-life of 2.3 minutes emitting a 1.78 MeV gamma ray. These gamma rays are counted in a detector placed below the source, with a high count indicating a high quantity of silicon in a sand pack, or aluminum in a bauxite pack.

Production Logging,"A record of the sound measured at different positions in the borehole. Since fluid turbulence generates sound, high noise amplitudes indicate locations of greater turbulence such as leaks, channels and perforations. Noise logging is used primarily for channel detection, but has also been used to measure flow rates, identify open perforations, detect sand production and locate gas-liquid interfaces. The log may be either a continuous record against depth or a series of stationary readings. The log may indicate the total signal over all frequencies, the signal at a single frequency, or consist of a set of logs for different frequency ranges. Different frequency ranges can be tied to different sources of noise or different flow regimes. Although first introduced around 1955, the technique was not used commercially until after laboratory studies in the early 1970s.",noise log

Production Logging,"A device for measuring the density of fluids in a completed well, using a radioactive source of gamma rays and a detector. In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement. Compared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution. On the other hand, it is not affected by well deviation, friction or kinetic effects.",nuclear fluid densimeter

Formation Evaluation,"Referring to a log of porosity based on the effect of the formation on fast neutrons emitted by a source. Hydrogen has by far the biggest effect in slowing down and capturing neutrons. Since hydrogen is found mainly in the pore fluids, the neutron porosity log responds principally to porosity. However, the matrix and the type of fluid also have an effect. The log is calibrated to read the correct porosity assuming that the pores are filled with fresh water and for a given matrix (limestone, sandstone or dolomite). It is presented in units of porosity (vol/vol or p.u.) for the matrix chosen. Older logs were presented in counts per second or API units. The depth of investigation is several inches, so that the log reads mainly in the flushed zone. The neutron porosity log is strongly affected by clay and gas. Hydrogen occurs in clays and hydrated minerals as well as pore fluids. Gas has a low hydrogen density, so that gas zones have a very low apparent porosity. The measurement is based on either thermal or epithermal neutron detection. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV, while epithermal neutrons have higher energy, between about 0.4 and 10 eV. Being a statistical measurement, the precision is greatest at high count rates, which in this case occurs at low porosity. Neutron porosity logs were introduced in the early 1940s. The first tools were known as neutron-gamma tools, since the detector measured the gamma rays emitted on capture. Neutron-neutron tools, using a thermal neutron detector were introduced in about 1950.",neutron porosity

Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation. There are two phases to the measurement: polarization and acquisition. First, the hydrogen atoms are aligned in the direction of a static magnetic field (B0). This polarization takes a characteristic time T1. Second, the hydrogen atoms are tipped by a short burst from an oscillating magnetic field that is designed so that they precess in resonance in a plane perpendicular to B0. The frequency of oscillation is the Larmor frequency. The precession of the hydrogen atoms induces a signal in the antenna. The decay of this signal with time is caused by transverse relaxation and is measured by the CPMG pulse sequence. The decay is the sum of different decay times, called T2. The T2 distribution is the basic output of a NMR measurement. The NMR measurement made by both a laboratory instrument and a logging tool follow the same principles very closely. An important feature of the NMR measurement is the time needed to acquire it. In the laboratory, time presents no difficulty. In a log, there is a trade-off between the time needed for polarization and acquisition, logging speed and frequency of sampling. The longer the polarization and acquisition, the more complete the measurement. However, the longer times require either lower logging speed or less frequent samples.",nuclear magnetic resonance measurement

Well Testing,"The theoretical flow capacity of gas wells if the bottomhole pressure could be reduced to atmospheric pressure. Test procedures to determine the AOF (Atmospheric Open-Flow) potential were often prescribed by law and enforced by state agencies. The open-flow potential capacity of the well was then used to determine the maximum rate that the gas well would be allowed to produce into a pipeline. During that period when there was an excessive amount of gas available for sale, this approach allowed an orderly method of allocating production rights to operators. The methodology is still used in some areas. The test required use of multiple rates, usually three or four, with measurement or calculation of the bottomhole pressure at the end of each flow period. The values of the difference between the square of the average reservoir pressure and the square of the bottomhole pressure were computed for each flow rate. These values were then plotted on the y-axis of a log-log plot versus the rate on the x-axis.

Drilling Fluids,The surface of contact between a water layer and an oil layer.,oil water interface
Well Completions,"A well completion that has no casing or liner set across the reservoir formation, allowing the produced fluids to flow directly into the wellbore. This type of completion suffers the major disadvantage that the sandface is unsupported and may collapse. Also, without any casing or liner installed, selective treatments or remedial work within the reservoir section are more difficult.",openhole completion
Well Workover and Intervention,"The maximum distortion permitted on the cross-sectional profile of a coiled tubing string. The mechanical performance of oval tubing deteriorates as the degree of ovality increases. The most critical effect is the ability of the tube to resist collapse under differential pressure. String ovality limits are generally determined by the maximum diameter that can pass through the primary pressure-control equipment. In high-pressure operations, the ovality limits will generally be reduced to maintain an adequate safety margin against string collapse.",ovality limit

Well Completions,"A type of sand-control completion in which the gravel pack screen is packed off in an openhole section with no casing or liner to support the producing formation. The openhole interval is often prepared by underreaming a section of reservoir below the last casing shoe. When the treatment is to be applied on an existing well, a section of casing may be milled out.",openhole gravel pack
Production Testing,"A condition in downhole pumping operations that occurs when the stroke length at the subsurface sucker-rod pump is longer than the surface stroke length (polished rod). This phenomenon is caused by the elongation of the rod string because of dynamic loads imposed by the pumping cycle. In this situation, when the upstroke begins at the surface, the downhole pump maybe still be moving downward; when the downstroke begins, the downhole pump is still moving upward.",over travel

Formation Evaluation," Enhanced Oil Recovery,Pertaining to the preference of a solid to be in contact with an oil phase rather than a water or gas phase. Oil-wet rocks preferentially imbibe oil. Generally, polar compounds or asphaltenes deposited from the crude oil onto mineral surfaces cause the oil-wet condition. Similar compounds in oil-base mud also can cause a previously water-wet rock to become partially or totally oil-wet.",oil wet

Drilling,"The amount of pressure (or force per unit area) in the wellbore that exceeds the pressure of fluids in the formation. This excess pressure is needed to prevent reservoir fluids (oil, gas, water) from entering the wellbore. However, excessive overbalance can dramatically slow the drilling process by effectively strengthening the near-wellbore rock and limiting removal of drilled cuttings under the bit. In addition, high overbalance pressures coupled with poor mud properties can cause differential sticking problems. Because reservoir pressures vary from one formation to another, while the mud is relatively constant density, overbalance varies from one zone to another.",overbalance
Well Completions,A drillstem test performed in an openhole section of the wellbore. The test once was a popular method of assessing the productivity of exploration wells without the need to run casing or liner across the reservoir interval. Openhole testing now is less common because of the risks and limits associated with fluid flow from an unsupported formation.,openhole test

Geophysics,"In surface seismic acquisition, the horizontal distance from source to receiver. In a vertical seismic profile, offset is the horizontal distance between the source and the wellhead or the surface projection of the receiver in the case of a deviated well.

Well Workover and Intervention,A specially prepared fluid used to displace matrix acid treatments away from the wellbore at the conclusion of a stimulation treatment. The overflush is typically formulated from a weak acid solution or brine to maintain a low pH environment in the near-wellbore formation that prevents the precipitation of reaction products as the treatment fluids are flowed back. The overflush is normally a weak acid or brine pumped behind the main treating fluid (mixture of hydrofluoric [HF] and hydrochloric [HCl] or organic acids). The overflush has several purposes: · displacement of the nonreacted mud acid into the formation. · displacement of mud-acid reaction by-products such as amorphous silica. The minimum overflush volume should have at least 3 ft [1 m] of radial penetration inside the formation to displace potential problems away from the critical matrix. · removal of potential oil-wet relative-permeability problems caused by some corrosion inhibitors.,overflush

Drilling Fluids,"An invert-emulsion mud, or an emulsion whose continuous phase is oil. In the past, the term referred to an oil mud containing less than about 5 vol.% water. This definition, at the time, distinguished mud with less than 5 vol.% water from invert-emulsion oil muds, which had more than 5 vol.% water.

Geology,"Subsurface pressure that is abnormally high, exceeding hydrostatic pressure at a given depth. The term geopressure is commonly, and incorrectly, used synonymously. Abnormally high pore pressure can occur in areas where burial of fluid-filled sediments is so rapid that pore fluids cannot escape, so the pressure of the pore fluids increases as overburden increases. Drilling into overpressured strata can be hazardous because overpressured fluids escape rapidly, so careful preparation is made in areas of known overpressure.",overpressure
Drilling,"An existing wellbore close to a proposed well that provides information for planning the proposed well. In planning development wells, there are usually numerous offsets, so a great deal is known about the subsurface geology and pressure regimes. In contrast, rank wildcats have no close offsets, and planning is based on interpretations of seismic data, distant offsets and prior experience. High-quality offset data are coveted by competent well planners to optimize well designs. When lacking offset data, the well planner must be more conservative in designing wells and include more contingencies.",offset well
Geology,"Pertaining to an oil field, an accumulation, pool or group of pools of oil in the subsurface.

Its internal chemistry must also accommodate a long shelf life.",oilfield battery
Drilling,"The company that serves as the overall manager and decision-maker of a drilling project. Generally, but not always, the operator will have the largest financial stake in the project. At the successful completion of logging the target zones, the decision to complete or plug and abandon generally has partner input and potential override clauses.

If the fish cannot be removed, a release system within the overshot allows the overshot to be disengaged and retrieved.",overshot
Production Facilities,"A vessel that separates the well fluids into gas and total liquid. A two-phase separator can be horizontal, vertical or spherical. The liquid (oil, emulsion) leaves the vessel at the bottom through a level-control or dump valve. The gas leaves the vessel at the top, passing through a mist extractor to remove the small liquid droplets in the gas. Separators can be categorized according to their operating pressure. Low-pressure units handle pressures of 10 to 180 psi [69 to 1,241 kPa]. Medium-pressure separators operate from 230 to 700 psi [1,586 to 4,826 kPa]. High-pressure units handle pressures of 975 to 1,500 psi [6,722 to 10,342 kPa]. Gravity segregation is the main force that accomplishes the separation, which means the heaviest fluid settles to the bottom and the lightest fluid rises to the top. Additionally, inside the vessel, the degree of separation between gas and liquid will depend on the separator operating pressure, the residence time of the fluid mixture and the type of flow of the fluid. Turbulent flow allows more bubbles to escape than laminar flow.",oil and gas separator
Drilling Fluids,"A chemical used in preparation and maintenance of an oil- or synthetic-base drilling fluid that forms a water-in-oil emulsion (invert emulsion). An oil-mud emulsifier lowers the interfacial tension between oil and water, which allows stable emulsions with small drops to be formed. Historically, oil-mud emulsifiers have been classified as primary and secondary. Secondary emulsifiers are generally not used alone to make a stable oil mud. Emulsifiers can be calcium fatty-acid soaps made from various fatty acids and lime, or derivatives such as amides, amines, amidoamines and imidazolines made by reactions of fatty acids and various ethanolamine compounds. These emulsifiers surround water droplets, like an encapsulating film, with the fatty acid component extending into the oil phase. Emulsifier molecules that cannot fit around drops form clusters (micelles) in the oil phase or adsorb onto solids. Oil-mud emulsion drops each behave like a small osmotic cell. The emulsifier around the drops acts like a semipermeable membrane through which water can move but ions cannot pass. Thus, oil muds have the special capability (which water muds do not have) to control water transfer to and from the drops simply by adjusting salinity within the water phase of the oil mud.",oil mud emulsifier
Production Logging,"A small sensor in a production logging tool that distinguishes the type of fluid in its vicinity as it is moved up and down a production well. The optical probe is sensitive to the optical index of the fluid in front of the probe. It can distinguish easily between gas and liquid, and less easily between oil and water. Light is sent from a source down a fiber-optic cable to the tip of the probe, and reflected back to a sensor, which converts it into an electrical signal. Gas, with a low optical index, reflects a significant amount of light and gives a large signal, while liquids give low signals. As with other local probes, the output is set to be nearly digital, so that the percentage of the time that the probe sees gas is a direct measure of gas holdup in front of the probe. By using several probes, it is possible to obtain the average holdup and an image of the flow structure across the well.",optical probe

Enhanced Oil Recovery,The portion of a reservoir where the oil saturation is increased because of the application of an improved oil recovery method.,oil bank
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A type of organic fluid, such as acetic or formic acid, used in oil and gas well-stimulation treatments. The use of inhibited HCl at elevated temperatures is limited to relatively short exposure times because of the risk of increased corrosion. Inhibited organic acids are much less reactive with metals than are HCl or mixtures of HCl and HF. For this reason, organic acids are commonly used successfully at high bottomhole temperatures or when long contact times between acid and pipe are needed, such as during perforating. Organic acids also are used to protect exotic alloys, such as aluminum or chrome-plated parts.",organic acid
Production Testing,"A condition in downhole pumping operations that occurs when the stroke length at the subsurface sucker-rod pump is longer than the surface stroke length (polished rod).

Small amounts of alcohol help to further dissolve asphaltenes.",organic deposit
Geology,"Abbreviation for oil-water contact, a bounding surface in a reservoir above which predominantly oil occurs and below which predominantly water occurs.

Drilling Fluids,"Ratio of the volume percent oil to the volume percent water in an oil mud, where each is a percent of the total liquid in the mud. OWR is calculated directly from the retort analysis of an oil mud. For example, if a mud contains 60 vol.% oil and 18 vol.% water, the oil percentage is [60/(60 + 18)]100 = 77% and the water percent is [18/(60 +18)] = 23%. That OWR is written as 77/23.",OWR
Drilling Fluids,"Clay minerals whose surfaces have been coated with a chemical to make them oil-dispersible. Bentonite and hectorite (plate-like clays) and attapulgite and sepiolite (rod-shaped clays) are treated with oil-wetting agents during manufacturing and are used as oil-mud additives. Quaternary fatty-acid amine is applied to the clay. Amine may be applied to dry clay during grinding or it can be applied to clay dispersed in water. The latter process is much more expensive, requiring filtering, drying and other manufacturing steps. Organophilic bentonite and hectorite, bentones, are used in oil muds to build rheology for cuttings lifting and solids suspension. They also contribute to low-permeability filter cake. Organophilic attapulgite and sepiolite are used in oil muds strictly to build gel structure, which may not be long lasting due to shear degradation as the mud is pumped through the bit.",organophilic clay
Formation Evaluation,"A model for converting relative elemental yields from a pulsed neutron spectroscopy log to absolute weight concentrations using the assumption that the sum of all oxides in the rock matrix is 1. The model is based on the observation that, with few exceptions, sedimentary minerals are oxides, so that the sum of the dry weight percent of all oxides must be 100%. The weight percent of an oxide can be calculated from the dry weight percent of the cation by knowing the chemical formula (for example, SiO2 from Si). The absolute dry weight percent, W, of element i is given by Wi = F * Yi / Si where F is the unknown normalization factor, Yi is the measured spectral gamma ray yield and Si is the tool sensitivity to that element, measured in the laboratory. The dry weight percent of the oxide is then Oi = F* Xi * Yi / Si where Xi is the oxide association factor, given by the chemical formula. Since the sum of all Oi equals 1, it is possible to calculate F and determine each Wi .",oxide closure model

Well Testing,"Oil and dissolved gas volume at reservoir conditions divided by oil volume at standard conditions. Since most measurements of oil and gas production are made at the surface, and since the fluid flow takes place in the formation, volume factors are needed to convert measured surface volumes to reservoir conditions. Oil formation volume factors are almost always greater than 1.0 because the oil in the formation usually contains dissolved gas that comes out of solution in the wellbore with dropping pressure.",oil formation volume factor

Production Logging,"A phenomenon exploited for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the flow of water in or around a borehole based on oxygen activation. Oxygen (16O) can be activated by high-energy neutrons to produce an isotope of nitrogen (16N), which decays back to oxygen with a half-life of 7.1 seconds and emits an easily detected gamma ray of 6.13 MeV. The neutrons are supplied by the generator of a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tool. The gamma rays are counted in detectors placed above the tool, for upward flow, or below it for downward flow. Various techniques have been developed to analyze the count rates in terms of water velocity, flow rate and distance from tool. The earliest methods were based of the ratio of the counts from two detectors. Stationary oxygen and other background signals are eliminated by calibration in a known zone of zero flow, by counting only in a window near 6.13 MeV, or by optimizing the detector spacings. More recently, impulse-activation techniques have been introduced. While they require the tool to be stationary, they are generally more accurate.",oxygen activation

Removal of air from a mud by defoaming and mechanical degassing is an essential first step before a scavenger can lower the dissolved oxygen content.",oxygen scavenger
Well Completions,"A chemical agent used in some brines and completion fluids to reduce corrosion resulting from, or exacerbated by, dissolved oxygen.

Formation Evaluation,"The effect on a propagation resistivity or induction log of charge buildup at the boundary between two formation layers with different dielectric properties. In a vertical well with horizontal layers, the current loops generated by the tool in the formation are parallel to the layers and do not cross bed boundaries. However, with an apparent dip between borehole and formation, the loops cross the bed boundaries and generate a charge buildup at the boundaries. The charge buildup acts like a secondary transmitter that increases the measured resistivity. The result is a spike to high resistivity as the tool crosses the bed boundary. In deviated or horizontal wells, polarization horns on measurements-while-drilling propagation logs often are used to detect a bed boundary. The spike increases with apparent dip and resistivity contrast between beds. The magnitude of polarization spikes varies with tool type and spacing, being larger for the propagation tools.",polarization horn

Formation Evaluation,"The time allotted for the alignment of hydrogen atoms with the static magnetic field during a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement. The alignment of hydrogen atoms follows an exponential rule such that after a polarization time PT the percentage aligned is 100*(1 ? e-PT/T1) where T1 is their longitudinal relaxation time. An infinite polarization time is therefore needed to align every hydrogen atom, but 95% are aligned after a time of 3*T1. Typical polarization times for a standard NMR log are between 1 and 4 s.",polarization time
Well Testing,"The analysis of pressure-transient behavior observed while the well is flowing. Results are generally much less accurate than those from pressure buildup tests because the bottomhole pressure fluctuates rapidly with even slight changes in the surface flow rate. Therefore, pressure buildup tests are much preferred, and analysis of drawdown test data is usually relegated to backup status unless the buildup data are flawed.",pressure drawdown analysis
Production Logging,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the flow is diverted through the spinner by a set of metal vanes, or petals. The vanes are closed while running in the hole, and then opened with the tool stationary at the measurement depth. The petals do not seal completely against each other or against the side of the hole, so that not all the fluid is diverted.

Drilling Fluids,"Linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+. The acrylic acid groups are evenly spaced along the chain. Acrylic acid polymer neutralized with NaOH is sodium polyacrylate (SPA). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup.

Drilling,"A device that can be run into a wellbore with a smaller initial outside diameter that then expands externally to seal the wellbore. Packers employ flexible, elastomeric elements that expand. The two most common forms are the production or test packer and the inflatable packer. The expansion of the former may be accomplished by squeezing the elastomeric elements (somewhat doughnut shaped) between two plates, forcing the sides to bulge outward. The expansion of the latter is accomplished by pumping a fluid into a bladder, in much the same fashion as a balloon, but having more robust construction. Production or test packers may be set in cased holes and inflatable packers are used in open or cased holes. They may be run on wireline, pipe or coiled tubing. Some packers are designed to be removable, while others are permanent. Permanent packers are constructed of materials that are easy to drill or mill out.",packer
Well Completions,"A downhole device used in almost every completion to isolate the annulus from the production conduit, enabling controlled production, injection or treatment.

Shale Gas,"A technique used to represent the history of a sedimentary basin, including the processes and components necessary to form petroleum: a petroleum source rock, a reservoir, a trapping mechanism, a seal, and the appropriate relative timing of formation of these. Using geologic, geophysical, and engineering data, scientists create a 3D model of the subsurface that can be used to understand whether petroleum is present and how much might exist in potential traps. Petroleum systems models can be used to help predict pore pressure and plan well construction and field development. A useful petroleum systems model can be used to identify and explain inconsistencies in the data. The resulting models are valuable during exploration for identifying resource richness, such as sweet spots in unconventional plays such as shale gas, and during field development and production for improving completion efficiency. Petroleum systems modeling is distinct from reservoir simulation in that it covers a larger scale that might include multiple oil and gas fields and considers a geologic time frame of millions of years rather than a production time frame of years or decades.",petroleum systems modeling

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Production Testing,Also known as primary recovery, the first stage of hydrocarbon production, in which natural reservoir energy, such as gasdrive, waterdrive or gravity drainage, displaces hydrocarbons from the reservoir, into the wellbore and up to surface. Initially, the reservoir pressure is considerably higher than the bottomhole pressure inside the wellbore. This high natural differential pressure drives hydrocarbons toward the well and up to surface. However, as the reservoir pressure declines because of production, so does the differential pressure. To reduce the bottomhole pressure or increase the differential pressure to increase hydrocarbon production, it is necessary to implement an artificial lift system, such as a rod pump, an electrical submersible pump or a gas-lift installation. Production using artificial lift is considered primary recovery. The primary recovery stage reaches its limit either when the reservoir pressure is so low that the production rates are not economical, or when the proportions of gas or water in the production stream are too high. During primary recovery, only a small percentage of the initial hydrocarbons in place are produced, typically around 10% for oil reservoirs.",primary production

Drilling,"To plug the wellbore around a drillstring. This can happen for a variety of reasons, the most common being that either the drilling fluid is not properly transporting cuttings and cavings out of the annulus or portions of the wellbore wall collapse around the drillstring.

At the frequencies used, the phase shift depends mainly on the resistivity of the material with a small dependence on dielectric permittivity, particularly at high resistivity. Common practice is to transform the phase shift to resistivity assuming that the dielectric permittivity is related to resistivity by a simple algorithm. The transform also depends on transmitter/receiver spacings and tool design. For a 2-MHz measurement, a typical measurement range is 0.2 to 200 ohm-m. Above 200 ohm-m, the dielectric effects become too variable and it is preferable to use the dielectric resistivity.",phase shift resistivity

As a wave travels through a medium, its energy moves at the group velocity (vg) and its individual phases, or components, move at their phase velocity (vp). The wave changes shape with distance as each frequency (f), or wavelength (λ), component moves at its separate phase velocity through the phenomenon of dispersion. Relative to the group velocity, each component moves with faster or slower phase velocity, depending on how phase velocity changes with wavelength or frequency. Slowness is the reciprocal of phase velocity.",phase velocity

Production Logging,"A record of the velocity with which a particular phase (gas, oil or water) moves in a producing well. While most flowmeters measure some average of all the fluids, the phase-velocity log identifies one particular phase. This is particularly important in highly deviated and horizontal wells with multiphase flow, where the flow structure is complicated. Phase-velocity measurements are made with either the crosscorrelation flowmeter, the water-flow log, or with chemical markers designed to mix specifically with one particular phase. Velocity-shot measurements, using radioactive tracers, have also been used. In a typical chemical marker technique, a gadolinium-rich marker is injected into the flow stream, dissolving in either oil or water. Gadolinium has a high capture cross section, or sigma, so that a slug of fluid with high sigma moves with the appropriate phase up the borehole. This slug can be detected by a standard pulsed-neutron capture tool, and the velocity of the phase computed from the time of flight between ejector and detector.",phase velocity log

When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",pore pressure
Drilling,"The pressure of the subsurface formation fluids, commonly expressed as the density of fluid required in the wellbore to balance that pore pressure.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A set of techniques used to prevent or considerably reduce paraffin deposition. Paraffin control might involve the following options: · use of paraffin inhibitors. · maintaining pipe surfaces in a water-wet condition because paraffin will not adhere to water. However, the presence of natural surfactants in some crude oils converts water-wet surfaces to an oil-wet condition, making this technique effective only temporarily. · coating the pipe with plastic to provide a smooth surface and reduce paraffin adhesion. · reducing heat transfer to maintain the oil temperature above its cloud point.

Production Logging,"A record of one or more in-situ measurements that describe the nature and behavior of fluids in or around the borehole during production or injection. Production logs are run for the purpose of analyzing dynamic well performance and the productivity or injectivity of different zones, diagnosing problem wells, or monitoring the results of a stimulation or completion. The term is sometimes extended to include logs run to measure the physical condition of the well, for example cement bond and corrosion logs. The earliest production logs consisted of temperature logs (1930s) and flowmeters (1940s), to which were soon added fluid-density and capacitance logs (1950s). Flow-rate measurements were gradually improved by the development of tracer logs and improvement to the basic spinner flowmeter. These techniques were adequate for near-vertical wells with single or biphasic flow, but could be misleading in highly deviated, and especially horizontal, wells. New techniques were developed starting in the 1980s. These techniques focused on local probes to measure holdup at different points in the borehole, nuclear techniques to analyze the total holdup of all three phases, and phase-velocity logs for the analysis of individual fluids. At the same time, complex flow structures and flow regimes have been studied more extensively using flow loops.",production log

Formation Evaluation,"A double logarithmic plot of a resistivity measurement on the x-axis versus a porosity measurement on the y-axis. The plot is named after G.R. Pickett. The plot is based on taking the logarithm of the Archie equation. Points of constant water saturation (Sw) will plot on a straight line with negative slope of value m. Water zones define the lowermost line on the plot. Since Sw = 1, the water resistivity can be determined from a point on the line. Once the water line is established, other parallel lines can be drawn for different Sw, assuming a constant n (usually 2). Other data can then be plotted and interpreted in terms of Sw. The same technique can be applied to the flushed zone, using flushed-zone measurements.

Geology,"The percentage of pore volume or void space, or that volume within rock that can contain fluids. Porosity can be a relic of deposition (primary porosity, such as space between grains that were not compacted together completely) or can develop through alteration of the rock (secondary porosity, such as when feldspar grains or fossils are preferentially dissolved from sandstones). Porosity can be generated by the development of fractures, in which case it is called fracture porosity. Effective porosity is the interconnected pore volume in a rock that contributes to fluid flow in a reservoir. It excludes isolated pores. Total porosity is the total void space in the rock whether or not it contributes to fluid flow. Thus, effective porosity is typically less than total porosity.

During this time the log readings are static but the depth, which is recorded by the movement of the cable, is changing.",pickup
Formation Evaluation,"The exponent, m, in the relation of formation factor (F) to porosity (phi). For a single sample, F is related to phi using the Archie equation F = 1 / phim, with m being the only coefficient needed. In this case, m has been related to many physical parameters, but above all to the tortuosity of the pore space. In theory, it can range from 1 for a bundle of tubes to infinity for porosity that is completely unconnected. For a simple packing of equal spheres, m = 1.5. With a more tortuous pore space or more isolated pores, m increases, while with fractures or conductive solids, m decreases. As a general average for typical reservoir rocks, m is often taken as 2. For a group of rock samples, it is common practice to find a relationship between F and phi that uses two coefficients (F = a / phim). In this case m, like a, becomes an empirical constant of best fit between F and phi, and may take a wide range of values. In complex formations, such as shaly sands or carbonates with multiple pore types, a constant m does not give good results. One solution is to vary m, with the variability related to parameters such as porosity, shaliness, or rock texture, or else determined directly from logs in zones where the water saturation is known or can be computed from a nonresistivity measurement such as electromagnetic propagation. In shaly sands, the preferred solution is to use a saturation equation, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM, in which m is defined as the intrinsic m, determined from the intrinsic formation factor at high salinities or after correction for the effect of shale. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, one solution is to use equations with different porosity exponents for each pore type. The volume of each pore type must then be determined from logs or borehole images.",porosity exponent

After the tube has spun in a centrifuge to settle the white sediment in the tube, the amount of precipitate is read and compared to a calibration chart that relates sediment to concentration of K+ in the filtrate sample. The test to monitor low potassium ion (K+) concentration in water-base muds, as prescribed by API, is a titration procedure using quaternary ammonium salt solution (QAS) as reagent. Potassium ion is first precipitated as the tetraphenylborate (TPB) salt by adding an excess of sodium tetraphenylborate. After filtering out the solid, the amount of TPB not reacted with K+ ion is titrated with a standard QAS solution. The endpoint is purple-to-light blue color change.",potassium ion

Well Workover and Intervention,An operating condition during a snubbing operation in which the wellhead pressure and buoyancy forces are greater than the force resulting from the weight of the pipe or tubing string. In the light-pipe condition the string will be ejected from the wellbore if the gripping force of the slips is lost.,pipe light
Drilling Fluids,"A class of muds that contain potassium ion (K+) dissolved in the water phase. Potassium muds are the most widely accepted water mud system for drilling water-sensitive shales, especially hard, brittle shales. K+ ions attach to clay surfaces and lend stability to shale exposed to drilling fluids by the bit. The ions also help hold the cuttings together, minimizing dispersion into finer particles. The presence of Na+ ions counteracts the benefits of K+ ions and should be minimized by using fresh water (not sea water) for make-up water. With time, Na+, Ca+2 and other ions accumulate from ion exchange with clays, making the mud less effective, but regular treatment to remove Ca+2 improves polymer function. Potassium chloride, KCl, is the most widely used potassium source. Others are potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, potassium lignite, potassium hydroxide and potassium salt of PHPA. Use of bentonite clay is restricted because of its strong affinity for K+. Instead, various polymers are used. XC polymer and PHPA are used for rheology. For fluid-loss control, mixtures of starch and polyanionic cellulose are often used. CM starch, HP starch, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium polyacrylate (SPA) are also used. PHPA is widely used for shale encapsulation. Potassium, lime and starch-like polymers have also been used as potassium mud systems. Although three API methods exist for determining the K+ ion concentration, the centrifuge method (for K+ >5000 mg/L) is the most accepted field method, and essential for daily monitoring of potassium in a mud. Regular additions of potassium salt maintain shale stability. K+ ion is rapidly consumed while drilling shallow, soft and highly dispersive (gumbo) shales, but maintaining sufficient K+ ion to stabilize gumbo can become expensive when drilling large holes. Researchers, notably Dr. Dennis O'Brien and Dr. Martin Chenevert (while at Exxon Production Research), evaluated different shales, their clay mineralogy and the concentration of K+ needed to stabilize them. Potassium muds above about 1 wt.% K+ ion usually fail the mysid shrimp (US EPA) bioassay test. Therefore, K-muds currently find low acceptance in offshore drilling in USA waters.Reference:O'Brien DE and Chenevert ME: Stabilizing Sensitive Shales with Inhibited Potassium-Based Drilling Fluids, Journal of Petroleum Technology 25, no. 9 (September 1973): 1089-1100.",potassium mud
Drilling Fluids,"The situation in which 10-second and 10-minute gel strengths for a drilling mud have dissimilar values, with the 10-minute number being much higher than the 10-second number. This indicates that the gelation of the mud is rapidly gaining strength with time, which generally is an undesirable feature of a mud. The mud may require excessive pump pressures to break circulation. If gels appear to be too progressive, a 30-minute gel-strength measurement may be warranted as a third check of progress.",progressive gels
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The degree of solubilization of a solute into each of multiple immiscible phases at equilibrium.

Drilling,"Onshore, two elevated truss-like structures having triangular cross sections. The pipe rack supports drillpipe, drill collars or casing above the ground. These structures are used in pairs located about 20 ft [6 m] apart and keep the pipe above ground level and closer to the level of the catwalk. Pipe stored horizontally on the pipe racks can have its threads cleaned and inspected and the rig crew may roll the pipe from one end of the pipe racks to the other with relative ease. The pipe racks are usually topped with a wooden board so as to not damage pipe, especially casing, as it is rolled back and forth along the racks. When large amounts of pipe are stored, wooden sills are placed between the layers of pipe to prevent damage.",pipe rack
Drilling,"Offshore, the storage bins for drillpipe, drill collars and casing. The offshore pipe rack functions similarly to the onshore version. Due to space limitations, offshore pipe racks tend to be narrower and routinely contain many layers of pipe.

Formation Evaluation,"A measurements-while-drilling log of formation resistivity. The log normally contains at least one attenuation and one phase-shift resistivity reading. In many cases there will be multiple curves of both, the difference being the depth of investigation. For the same nominal depth of investigation, the attenuation resistivity reads deeper than the phase-shift resistivity and is less affected by invasion, but more affected by surrounding beds and apparent dip. The attenuation measurement has a poorer vertical resolution and is less affected by anisotropy. Depths of investigation and vertical resolution of both measurements vary with the average formation resistivity. Although depths of investigation are less than with wireline resistivity logs, the invasion at the time of measurement is usually small and it is possible to derive the resistivity of the undisturbed zone.",propagation resistivity

For example: (1) Calcite in a ground barite sample may be 400 ppm. (2) Calcium chloride in a water solution may be 250,000 ppm. Note that the relationship of ppm to weight percentage is 10,000 ppm = 1 wt.%. For gases, ppm refers to volume (or mole) units. For example, H2S in an air sample may be 10 ppm (both by volume and by moles).",parts per million

Drilling Fluids,"The lowest temperature (in °F or °C) at which a liquid remains pourable (meaning it still behaves as a fluid). Oil or synthetic muds with high pour points may suffer from poor screening and excessive pressure, surges in deepwater wells or other operations subject to low temperatures. In oils, the pour point is generally increased by a high paraffin content. The pour point of liquid additives is an important consideration for arctic drilling operations.",pour point
Heavy Oil,"The temperature at which a fluid ceases to pour. The pour point for oil can be determined under protocols set forth in the ASTM D-97 pour point test, in which the pour point is established as that temperature at which oil ceases to flow when the sample is held at 90 degrees to the upright for five seconds. High pour points usually occur in crude oils that have significant paraffin content. Paraffins (or waxes) will start to precipitate as temperature decreases. At some point the precipitates accumulate to the point where the fluid can no longer flow. This phenomenon can occur with light oils as well as heavy oils.",pour point
Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the formation resistivity made on drillpipe at a frequency in the range of 100 kHz to 10 GHz, most commonly 2 MHz. The basic measurement is accomplished using a transmitter and two receivers. At these frequencies, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus, the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the phase shift and the attenuation resistivity. In practice, multiple transmitters may be used to obtain different depths of investigation and achieve borehole compensation. The wavelength is such that the borehole has a minor effect, but one for which correction may be needed.",propagation resistivity measurement

Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the high frequency (about 1 GHz) dielectric properties of the formation. In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array. An ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake. Borehole compensation is used to correct for sonde tilt or a rough borehole wall.",propagation time

Formation Evaluation,"An electrode device with small spacings from which the current flow, and hence the measurement, is focused a short distance into the formation. The proximity log measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The central current-emitting electrode (A0) is surrounded by a guard electrode that emits sufficient current to focus the current from A0 a certain distance into the formation. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. In a typical tool design, 90% of the signal comes from within 5 to 10 in. [13 to 25 cm] of the pad. This is deeper than the microlaterolog, which ensures that the mudcake has less effect but means that the proximity log is more often affected by the undisturbed zone.",proximity log

Drilling,"Also known as pressure integrity test or leakoff test, a test to determine the strength or fracture pressure of the open formation, usually conducted immediately after drilling below a new casing shoe. During the test, the well is shut in and fluid is pumped into the wellbore to gradually increase the pressure that the formation experiences. At some pressure, fluid will enter the formation, or leak off, either moving through permeable paths in the rock or by creating a space by fracturing the rock. The results of the leakoff test dictate the maximum pressure or mud weight that may be applied to the well during drilling operations. To maintain a small safety factor to permit safe well control operations, the maximum operating pressure is usually slightly below the leakoff test result.",PIT
Drilling Fluids,"A specialized apparatus used in the particle-plugging test. The PPA is used to determine the ability of particles in the drilling fluid to effectively bridge the pores in the filter medium and, therefore, the ability of the mud to reduce formation damage in the reservoir. The apparatus resembles a high-pressure, high-temperature filtration cell that has been modified to operate upside down (to remove the effects of gravity) and to accept filter media of different permeabilities (sintered metal, which is chosen for higher temperature conditions, aloxite, which is a porous ceramic material, or rock). The medium is selected to match the permeability of the reservoir to be drilled. The filter medium is at the top so that sediment will not affect the filter cake. Pressure is applied hydraulically from below.",PPA
Formation Evaluation,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance. The pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as: Jx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut) where Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).",pseudogeometrical factor

During directional drilling, this capability is used while drilling in sliding mode, when the drillstring is not rotated from the surface. Positive displacement motors can also be used for performance drilling, straight hole drilling, coring, underreaming, and milling operations. In straight hole drilling, the motor functions as a drilling performance tool to increase the rate of penetration and reduce casing wear by minimizing drillstring rotation.",PDM

Formation Evaluation,"The ideal spontaneous potential (SP) that would be observed opposite a shaly, permeable bed if the SP currents were prevented from flowing. In the middle of a thick, permeable bed whose resistivity is not too high, the SP reads close to the pseudostatic spontaneous potential (PSP). In other conditions, however, the SP may be significantly less than the PSP. The PSP ignores other potential sources and assumes that a surrounding shale is a perfect cationic membrane. The ratio of the PSP to the static spontaneous potential is known as the SP reduction factor, alpha. Alpha is less than 1 and is a function of the shaliness, or cation-exchange capacity, within the sand. The higher this cation-exchange capacity, the larger the internal membrane potential. The latter has the opposite polarity to the liquid-junction potential and reduces the SP. The PSP, and alpha, are reduced when hydrocarbons are introduced into shaly sands, because the cation-exchange capacity in the sands is forced into a smaller conductive pore volume and therefore has a larger relative effect.",pseudostatic spontaneous potential

Well Testing,"Behavior observed when a well reaches stabilized production from a limited drainage volume. For constant-rate production, under pseudosteady state, the difference between the flowing wellbore pressure and the average reservoir pressure in the drainage volume is constant, and the pressure drawdown is a linear function of time, resulting in a unit slope in the log-log pressure derivative.

Formation Evaluation,"A log of photoelectric absorption properties. The log measures the photoelectric absorption factor, Pe, which is defined as (Z/10) 3.6 where Z is the average atomic number of the formation. Pe is unitless, but since it is proportional to the photoelectric cross section per electron, it is sometimes quoted in barns/electron. Since fluids have very low atomic numbers, they have very little influence, so that Pe is a measure of the rock matrix properties. Sandstones have low Pe, while dolomites and limestones have high Pe. Clays, heavy minerals and iron-bearing minerals have high Pe. Thus, the log is very useful for determining mineralogy. In interpretation, PEF is normally converted to the simpler volumetric cross section, U in barns/cm3, by taking the product of PEF and density. The log is recorded as part of the density measurement. The depth of investigation is of the order of one inch, which is normally in the flushed zone. PEF can be affected by heavy minerals such as barite in the mudcake or mud filtrate.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A reaction by-product. In sandstone acidizing, the reaction between hydrofluoric acids [HF] or spent HF acids with formation minerals can precipitate nondamaging products, such as silica, borosilicates or fluoborates. However, other insoluble or difficult to remove by-products can create formation damage. Ferric iron (Fe+3) and ferrous iron (Fe+2) are potential sources for precipitates. Ferric iron present in some formation minerals, including chlorite and glauconite clays, and in tubing rust (iron oxide) can precipitate as ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3], which is a gelatinous, highly insoluble mass that can plug pore channels and reduce permeability. The precipitation of ferric hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide [Fe(OH)2] depends on the pH of the spent acid. The former needs a pH higher than 2.2, while the latter requires a pH higher than 7.7. Since the maximum pH for a spent acid is approximately 5.3, the precipitation of ferric hydroxide is more common. Iron-sequestering or iron-reducing agents can be used in acid to maintain the ferric iron in solution. Calcium fluoride [CaF2] precipitates when HF contacts calcite or any other calcium source, and alkali-fluosilicates or iron sulfide form crystal-like by-products that can bridge pore throats. Additionally, some sequestering agents, corrosion inhibitors or friction reducers can also form residues that may plug formation pores. The formation of precipitates can be avoided or reduced by using a preflush, which dissolves calcareous material, iron rust or iron scales, and displaces formation brines (K, Na, Ca ions) away from the wellbore, thereby reducing the formation of CaF2, ferric hydroxide and alkali-fluosilicates.",precipitate

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A standard laboratory instrument used to measure interfacial tension. The method is particularly applicable to relatively high interfacial tensions, but with care can measure down to approximately 1 mN/m. A drop of the denser liquid is poised at the end of a square-ended syringe needle. The drop is of sufficient size that its shape is deformed by gravity, but not so large that it detaches from the syringe. Its shape is determined by the balance of interfacial tension and gravity. The interfacial tension can be obtained from the drop shape and the densities of the two liquids. The method works equally well for a drop of the less-dense liquid by inverting the syringe. This inverted configuration can be useful if the less-dense liquid is opaque.",pendant drop tensiometer

Formation Evaluation,"A technique in which an ultrasonic transducer, in transmit mode, emits a high-frequency acoustic pulse towards the borehole wall, where it is reflected back to the same transducer operating in receive mode. The measurement consists of the amplitude of the received signal, the time between emission and reception, and sometimes the full waveform received. Tools that use this technique either have multiple transducers, facing in different directions, or rotate the transducer while making measurements, thereby obtaining a full image of the borehole wall. Pulse-echo techniques are used in the borehole televiewer. In cased hole, the waveform is analyzed to give indications of cement-bond quality and casing corrosion.",pulse echo
Drilling Fluids,Dispersal of a substance into a colloidal form or dispersal of a clay in water to form a colloidal suspension.,peptization
Drilling Fluids,"A parameter of the Bingham plastic model. PV is the slope of the shear stress/shear rate line above the yield point. PV represents the viscosity of a mud when extrapolated to infinite shear rate on the basis of the mathematics of the Bingham model. (Yield point, YP, is the other parameter of that model.) A low PV indicates that the mud is capable of drilling rapidly because of the low viscosity of mud exiting at the bit. High PV is caused by a viscous base fluid and by excess colloidal solids. To lower PV, a reduction in solids content can be achieved by dilution of the mud.",plastic viscosity
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A fluid stage, normally hydrochloric acid [HCl], pumped ahead of the main treating fluid (mixture of hydrofluoric [HF] and hydrochloric [HCl] or organic acids) in a sandstone matrix-stimulation treatment. One of the purposes of a preflush is to displace formation brines that contain K, Na, Ca ions away from the wellbore, decreasing the possibility of crystallizing alkali-fluosilicates that could plug the pores. The other purpose of a preflush is to dissolve calcareous materials to minimize calcium fluoride [CaF2] precipitation, and to dissolve iron scale or rust to avoid the precipitation of the gelatinous, highly insoluble ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3]. Multiple preflush stages using brines such as ammonium chloride [NH4Cl] or solvents are used when multiple damage types are present. A preflush is sometimes called a spearhead.",preflush
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"In chemical flooding, a fluid stage, normally low-salinity water, pumped ahead of the micellar or alkaline chemical solution. One of the purposes of the preflush is to displace reservoir brine containing potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium ions from the near-wellbore area, avoiding adverse interactions with the chemical solution. The other purposes are to adjust reservoir salinity to favorable conditions for the surfactant (chemical solution) and to obtain information about reservoir flow patterns. Sometimes a preflush stage is not necessary, especially when brine-tolerant chemical systems are used.",preflush
Production Logging,"A record of the fractions, or holdups, of gas, oil and water present at different depths in a producing well using a combination of nuclear measurements recorded by a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy device. The technique is used mainly in deviated and horizontal wells, where the complex flow regimes cause conventional holdup measurements to be inaccurate. The pulsed-neutron spectroscopy measurement is processed to obtain the volume of oil in the borehole rather than the oil in the formation as in a conventional carbon-oxygen measurement. The gas holdup is determined from the ratio of counts received by the near and far detectors in either the inelastic or capture mode, a technique similar to the compensated-neutron log. The water holdup is the remaining fraction. Alternatively, the capture cross section of the borehole can be determined from the pulsed-neutron capture measurement. If the water is saline, and its salinity is known, the water holdup can be determined directly.",pulsed neutron holdup log

Drilling Fluids,A water-soluble starch that has undergone irreversible changes by heating in water or steam.,pregelatinized starch
Formation Evaluation,"A wireline log of the yields of different elements in the formation, measured using induced gamma ray spectroscopy with a pulsed neutron generator. The elemental yields are derived from two intermediate results: the inelastic and the capture spectrum. The inelastic spectrum is the basis for the carbon-oxygen log, and can also give information on other elements. The capture spectrum depends on many elements, mainly hydrogen, silicon, calcium, iron, sulfur and chlorine. Since the elemental yields give information only on the relative concentration of elements, they are normally given as ratios, such as C/O, Cl/H, Si/(Si + Ca), H/(Si + Ca) and Fe/(Si + Ca). These ratios are indicators of oil, salinity, lithology, porosity and clay, respectively. To get absolute concentrations, it is necessary to calibrate to cores or, more often, use a model such as the oxide-closure model. The depth of investigation of the log is several inches into the formation. It can be run in open or cased hole. Pulsed neutron spectroscopy logs were introduced in the mid 1970s after a decade or more of investigation.",pulsed neutron spectroscopy log

Geology,"The unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.",plate tectonics
Drilling Fluids,To mix with water and allow to react or yield in the water before use. Prehydrating is a common technique for incorporating bentonite in cement slurry or drilling mud. Prehydration may also be done for convenience in cementing operations to allow mixing of water containing the additives with powdered neat cement. Additives also may be prehydrated with mix water to avoid dry-blending the additives with cement.,prehydrate
Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the spectrum of gamma rays emitted by a formation bombarded by high-energy neutrons. Neutrons are emitted by a high-energy neutron generator (14.1 MeV). The neutrons interact with different nuclei, which may emit characteristic gamma rays through inelastic neutron scattering, fast-neutron reactions and neutron capture. When pulses from a neutron generator are used, it is possible to separate the different interactions in time after each neutron pulse. Inelastic and fast-neutron interactions occur very soon after the neutron burst, while most of the capture events occur later. The two types can therefore be separated to give a so-called inelastic spectrum and a capture spectrum. The spectra are analyzed either by counting gamma rays in windows placed at the main peaks for the elements concerned, or by comparison with spectral standards, or by combining the two (alpha processing). The resultant logs are known as pulsed neutron spectroscopy logs, the most common of which are the carbon-oxygen log and the elemental capture spectroscopy log.",pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurement
Drilling Fluids,"A product that enhances dispersion of a substance (such as clay) into colloidal form. Peptizing agents for drilling-mud clays are sodium carbonate, sodium metaphosphates, sodium polyacrylates, sodium hydroxide and other water-soluble sodium compounds, even common table salt, NaCl, if added at low concentration. The divalent cations on a clay are replaced by the sodium cations, aiding clay hydration and dispersion. Greater benefit is attained by an agent that contributes an anion (for example, carbonate, phosphate or polyacrylate) that precipitates divalent cations and removes them from solution. This process is successful only when the water first contacted is free of hardness ions, otherwise the anion in the peptizing salt (or polymer) will be precipitated by the hard water and make the peptizing agent much less effective.",peptizing agent
Geology,A topographic feature consisting of a large flat area at a relatively high elevation with steep sides.,plateau
Drilling Fluids,"A concentrated slurry of bentonite clay mixed in fresh water. The maximum practical concentration of bentonite is about 30 to 40 lbm/bbl because greater concentrations of bentonite are difficult to mix and pump. Water is put into the rig's prehydration tank and the pH raised to 10 or 11 with caustic soda. Soda ash is added as required to remove hardness. Bentonite is slowly added through the mud hopper. Continual energetic mixing and stirring helps the clay particles fully disperse. In some muds, lignosulfonate should be added shortly before mixing the slurry into the active system to protect the colloidal clay particles from flocculation.",prehydrated bentonite
Perforating,"To create holes in the casing or liner to achieve efficient communication between the reservoir and the wellbore. The characteristics and placement of the communication paths (perforations) can have significant influence on the productivity of the well.

Bactericides are commonly used in water muds containing natural starches and gums that are especially vulnerable to bacterial attack. Bactericide choices are limited and care must be taken to find those that are effective yet approved by governments and by company policy. Bactericides, also called biocides, can be used to control sulfate-reducing bacteria, slime-forming bacteria, iron-oxidizing bacteria, and bacteria that attacks polymers in fracture and secondary recovery fluids.

Drilling,"To prepare a well to be closed permanently, usually after either logs determine there is insufficient hydrocarbon potential to complete the well, or after production operations have drained the reservoir. Different regulatory bodies have their own requirements for plugging operations. Most require that cement plugs be placed and tested across any open hydrocarbon-bearing formations, across all casing shoes, across freshwater aquifers, and perhaps several other areas near the surface, including the top 20 to 50 ft [6 to 15 m] of the wellbore. The well designer may choose to set bridge plugs in conjunction with cement slurries to ensure that higher density cement does not fall in the wellbore. In that case, the bridge plug would be set and cement pumped on top of the plug through drillpipe, and then the drillpipe withdrawn before the slurry thickened.",plug and abandon

Production Logging,"A multiphase flow regime in pipes in which most of the gas moves as large bubbles dispersed within a continuous liquid. The bubbles may span much of the pipe. There are also small bubbles within the liquid, but many of these have coalesced to form the larger bubbles, or plugs. In near-horizontal wells, the plugs are also known as elongated bubbles.

Well Completions,"An artificial-lift method principally used in gas wells to unload relatively small volumes of liquid. An automated system mounted on the wellhead controls the well on an intermittent flow regime. When the well is shut-in, a plunger is dropped down the production string. When the control system opens the well for production, the plunger and a column of fluid are carried up the tubing string. The surface receiving mechanism detects the plunger when it arrives at surface and, through the control system, prepares for the next cycle.",plunger lift
Production Testing,"A type of gas-lift method that uses a plunger that goes up and down inside the tubing. The plunger provides an interface between the liquid phase and the lift gas, minimizing liquid fallback. The plunger has a bypass valve that opens at the top of the tubing and closes when it reaches the bottom.

Production Testing,"A condition in downhole pumping operations that occurs when the stroke length at the subsurface sucker-rod pump is longer than the surface stroke length (polished rod). This phenomenon is caused by the elongation of the rod string because of dynamic loads imposed by the pumping cycle.

Well Testing,The pressure decline after halting or reducing fluid injection in a well. Pressure falloff tests in injection wells are analogous to pressure buildup tests in production wells.,pressure falloff
Well Testing,"A well produced by use of some kind of downhole pump. Pumps are required when the formation pressure is not sufficient to allow flowing production of fluids at the desired or necessary rate. The performance of well tests on pumping wells is always complicated by the presence of the pump, which often must be removed to take downhole pressure measurements. Downhole pressure measurements in pumping wells are usually made by measuring the rise in liquid level in the well. This is often accomplished by sonic devices, like well sounders, that measure the response time of sound waves bounced off the downhole liquid surface. Most oil wells are eventually put on pumps as pressure declines during production. The exceptions are in strong waterdrive reservoirs or in settings where pressure maintenance by gas or water injection is sufficient to maintain a high reservoir pressure.",pumping well

Well Testing,"A device used to measure pressure. Many different types of pressure gauges have been developed for use in well testing over the years. For bottomhole pressure measurements, these include helical bourdon tube gauges, strain gauges, quartz crystal gauges and surface readout gauges. All have their roles, and are still in use. Digital memory gauges are popular at the moment, since the data can be printed out or input directly into a computer for immediate use. Proper use of the data often requires specific knowledge of the possible idiosyncrasies of the particular gauge used in a test.",pressure gauge
Well Testing,"Testing that is accomplished by measuring pressure in the annulus, or by pulling the pump and running a pressure gauge in the hole. The preferred method is usually to measure the pressure in the annulus if no packer is present. This is best done by monitoring the rise in fluid level with an echo-sounding device and calculating the bottomhole pressure by assuming a fluid density. Several excellent devices and associated services are available. Any time a well is shut in gradually, as is the case for pumping wells, some kind of multirate analysis is usually required to obtain acceptable results.",pumping well tests

The normal hydrostatic pressure gradient for freshwater is 0.433 psi/ft, or 9.792 kPa/m, and 0.465 psi/ft for water with 100,000 ppm total dissolved solids (a typical Gulf Coast water), or 10.516 kPa/m. Deviations from normal pressure are described as high or low pressure.",pressure gradient
Well Testing,"A change in pressure as a function of distance. This can refer to radial change in pore pressure with distance from the well (which can be calculated from well-test analysis results), to change in pore pressure with depth (which can be measured by formation tests, and implies formation fluid density and/or fluid contacts) or to change in wellbore fluid pressure with depth (which can be measured with production logs, and implies wellbore fluid density).",pressure gradient
Perforating,"The radial distribution of successive perforating charges around the gun axis. Perforating gun assemblies are commonly available in 0-, 180-, 120-, 90- and 60-degree phasing.

Drilling,"The evaluation of various well parameters in an attempt to identify when the pore pressure in a drilling well is changing. A team consisting of geologists, engineers and most of the rigsite personnel usually conducts the hunt. The purpose of a pressure hunt is to detect the pore pressure transition (usually from lower to higher pressure) and safely set casing in the transition zone to maximize wellbore strength. A casing string set too shallow, while eliminating some problems associated with drilling fluid contacting the wellbore wall, may not add strength or aid in drilling deeper, perhaps abnormally pressured formations. On the other hand, if drilling is continued too deep into a transition zone, a kick may be taken that cannot be contained in the open wellbore, causing an underground blowout. The hunt team, therefore, seeks to get into the transition zone far enough to gain wellbore strength without taking a kick.",pressure hunt
Geophysics,"A phenomenon of relative seismic velocities of strata whereby a shallow layer or feature with a low seismic velocity (e.g., a shale diapir or a gas chimney) surrounded by rock with a higher seismic velocity causes what appears to be a structural low beneath it. After such features are converted from time to depth, the apparent structural low is generally reduced in magnitude.

Drilling,"Also known as leakoff test, a test to determine the strength or fracture pressure of the open formation, usually conducted immediately after drilling below a new casing shoe. During the test, the well is shut in and fluid is pumped into the wellbore to gradually increase the pressure that the formation experiences. At some pressure, fluid will enter the formation, or leak off, either moving through permeable paths in the rock or by creating a space by fracturing the rock. The results of the leakoff test dictate the maximum pressure or mud weight that may be applied to the well during drilling operations. To maintain a small safety factor to permit safe well control operations, the maximum operating pressure is usually slightly below the leakoff test result.",pressure integrity test

Drilling Fluids,"A parameter of the Bingham plastic model. PV is the slope of the shear stress/shear rate line above the yield point. PV represents the viscosity of a mud when extrapolated to infinite shear rate on the basis of the mathematics of the Bingham model. (Yield point, YP, is the other parameter of that model.) A low PV indicates that the mud is capable of drilling rapidly because of the low viscosity of mud exiting at the bit. High PV is caused by a viscous base fluid and by excess colloidal solids. To lower PV, a reduction in solids content can be achieved by dilution of the mud.",PV
Production Testing,"A situation in which the well and the reservoir are continuously monitored. On the basis of this information, the well completion may be adjusted remotely to adapt to changes in downhole conditions. A permanent well monitoring system is composed of the following: · Inflow control valves that enable choking or shutting off different zones according performance such as drawdown, GOR or water cut · Downhole sensors that register pressure, fluid flow rate and temperature · Control lines for power transmission and transferring of monitored downhole data captured by downhole sensors. · A surface control unit to handle the monitored data and for remote operation of the downhole inflow control valves. Wells with permanent monitoring systems are commonly called intelligent or smart wells. Permanent well monitoring is commonly used in multilateral wells, where hydraulically independent valves control the flow of each lateral and in deepwater wells, where well-intervention operations are often prohibitively expensive. Permanent well monitoring helps improve reservoir management by quickly choking or shutting off zones, avoiding expensive well intervention. It also helps maximize production and optimize recovery.",permanent well monitoring

Drilling Fluids,"A shorthand term for pressure, volume, temperature dependencies for fluid properties. In oil-base drilling fluids, PVT effects on viscosity and density must be understood to develop density and hydraulics programs.

Geology,"The ability, or measurement of a rock's ability, to transmit fluids, typically measured in darcies or millidarcies. The term was basically defined by Henry Darcy, who showed that the common mathematics of heat transfer could be modified to adequately describe fluid flow in porous media. Formations that transmit fluids readily, such as sandstones, are described as permeable and tend to have many large, well-connected pores. Impermeable formations, such as shales and siltstones, tend to be finer grained or of a mixed grain size, with smaller, fewer, or less interconnected pores. Absolute permeability is the measurement of the permeability conducted when a single fluid, or phase, is present in the rock. Effective permeability is the ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid through a rock when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir (for example, effective permeability of gas in a gas-water reservoir). The relative saturations of the fluids as well as the nature of the reservoir affect the effective permeability. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows for comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",permeability

It is used for a large number of reservoir engineering calculations such as prediction of future performance, secondary and tertiary recovery potential, and potential success of well-stimulation procedures. Obtaining the best possible value of this product is the primary objective of transient well tests. To separate the elements of the product, it is necessary to have some independent measurement of one of them, usually the estimation of producing formation thickness from well logs. Permeability is then calculated, provided that the fluid formation volume factor and viscosity are known. The accuracy of the calculated permeability is entirely dependent on the accuracy of the estimated formation thickness and the fluid properties.",permeability thickness

Geology,"The pressure of fluids within the pores of a reservoir, usually hydrostatic pressure, or the pressure exerted by a column of water from the formation's depth to sea level. When impermeable rocks such as shales form as sediments are compacted, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to anomalously high formation pressures. Because reservoir pressure changes as fluids are produced from a reservoir, the pressure should be described as measured at a specific time, such as initial reservoir pressure.",reservoir pressure

Drilling,"To place a stand of drillpipe in the derrick when coming out of the hole on a trip. The rig crew racks back pipe after the stand is unscrewed from the rest of the drillstring. The floor crew then pushes the lower part of the stand away from the rotary table to a position on one side of the vee-door. While the floor crew is pushing the pipe, the derrickman gets ready to pull the top of the stand over into the fingerboards. Once the rig crew has the pipe in the correct location, the driller slacks off on the drawworks, allowing the stand to rest on the drillfloor. This takes weight off of the elevators previously supporting the pipe at the top, so the derrickman can then unlatch the elevators and pull the top of the pipe into the fingerboards for storage. Modern rig designs have automated pipe-handling equipment that moves the pipe. When tripping the pipe out of the hole, racking back pipe may occur every two to five minutes for hours at a time.",racking back pipe

Like a laterolog, the signal is proportional to resistivity, and is thus most effective at high resistivities, high formation to mud-resistivity contrast and in the presence of conductive invasion. It is usually combined with the bit resistivity, and possibly also with the button resistivities.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A type of bimetallic corrosion. Ringworm corrosion has the shape of a ring and is located a few inches from the pipe upset. The ring can either be very smooth or have severe pitting. Ringworm corrosion is caused by the upsetting process, in which the heat required for upsetting creates two different grain structures, one in the upset and another in the rest of the pipe. This condition can be avoided by fully normalizing the pipe after upsetting. To normalize the pipe, heat is applied to change the grains to a uniform structure.",ringworm corrosion
Production Logging,"A record of the difference in temperature between the opposite sides of the internal wall of a casing. The log is mainly used to detect a channel in the cement, since the fluid moving in the channel is likely to be cooler or warmer than its surroundings. The two temperature probes are held on arms that are extended to touch the casing wall at depths where a channel is suspected. The assembly is then rotated through 360o to give the radial differential-temperature log. A sinusoid indicates a channel.

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A laboratory device used to indicate miscibility between reservoir oil and injection gas. A gas bubble is injected into an oil-filled visual cell at a given temperature and test pressure. The change in shape of the rising bubble indicates its miscibility with the oil at those conditions. Below the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the bubble holds its shape as it rises. Above the MMP, the bubble shape changes as it rises; it may disintegrate, dissolve or disappear into the oil. Testing at several pressures helps determine the MMP between the gas and oil. The rising-bubble test represents a forward-contacting miscibility process and therefore may not accurately estimate the MMP for a backward or combined contact mechanism.",rising bubble apparatus

This reservoir engineering quantity signifies the ultimate recovery under a given displacement process and represents the endpoint of the relative permeability curves in reservoir simulation. The residual oil saturation quantity is the saturation achieved after an infinite number of pore volumes of the displacing fluid have flowed through a particular portion of reservoir rock. To define residual oil saturation, the displacement method and the type, volume, direction and velocity of the displacing fluid must be known. Residual oil saturation is the ratio of the immobile residual oil volume divided by the effective porosity.",residual oil saturation
Geology,"An aggregate of minerals or organic matter (in the case of coal, which is not composed of minerals because of its organic origin), or volcanic glass (obsidian, which forms a rock but is not considered a mineral because of its amorphous, noncrystalline nature). Rocks can contain a single mineral, such as rock salt (halite) and certain limestones (calcite), or many minerals, such as granite (quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals). There are three main types of rocks. Sedimentary rocks like sandstone and limestone form at the Earth's surface through deposition of sediments derived from weathered rocks, biogenic activity or precipitation from solution. Igneous rocks originate deeper within the Earth, where the temperature is high enough to melt rocks, to form magma that can crystallize within the Earth or at the surface by volcanic activity. Metamorphic rocks form from other preexisting rocks during episodes of deformation of the Earth at temperatures and pressures high enough to alter minerals but inadequate to melt them. Such changes can occur by the activity of fluids in the Earth and movement of igneous bodies or regional tectonic activity. Rocks are recycled from one type to another by the constant changes in the Earth.",rock
Formation Evaluation,"A distance that characterizes the ability of a logging measurement to resolve changes in the formation perpendicular to the tool. Alternatively, the term refers to the smallest distance for which a significant change can be detected. The resolution is a feature of the radial response, which is often summarized by a geometrical or pseudogeometrical factor. A measurement with good or high radial resolution will have a sharp peak in the radial differential geometric factor at some distance from the tool.",radial resolution
Well Workover and Intervention,The tension applied to a coiled tubing string as it passes between the reel and the injector head. An adequate back-tension must be maintained to ensure that the string spools correctly on or off the reel.,reel back tension
Drilling Fluids,"Organic material having low solubility. Resins are usually large and complex polymeric molecules with noncrystalline structure and no distinct melting point or other definitive properties. Resins are used as additives to improve filter cake, provide lubricity or stop lost circulation as lost-circulation material. Resins are derived from plant sources (such as pine trees), some are residues of manufacturing processes and some resins are mined material.",resin
Heavy Oil,"One of the four main components of petroleum, along with asphaltenes, aromatics and saturates (which include waxes). Resins, aromatics and saturates are also known as maltenes. Resin adds to the stickiness and viscosity of heavy oil.",resin
Geophysics,"The study of the physical characteristics and behavior of rock. Rock mechanics can include analysis of and relationships between properties such as velocity, density, porosity, permeability, shear strength, and bending and crushing behavior, as well as the greater geological context of forces that deform strata and produce geological structures.",rock mechanics
Formation Evaluation,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of the distance perpendicular to the tool. Radial responses are determined by computer simulation or laboratory measurement. For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the radial response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the radial response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted radial responses have been determined in formations that are vertically homogeneous and have small radial changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor. These factors are appropriate for volumetric measurements such as nuclear and resistivity measurements, but not for others such as acoustic propagation.",radial response
Formation Evaluation,"A situation in which the resistivity of the flushed zone is greater than the resistivity of the undisturbed zone. Such a setting generally favors the use of induction devices, which respond to conductivity, rather than electrode resistivity devices (laterologs, ring resistivity), which respond to resistivity.",resistive invasion
Reservoir Characterization,The physical characteristics of reservoir rocks that enable them to store fluids and to allow fluids to flow through them. The main properties of interest are rock porosities and permeabilities.,rock properties
Perforating,"Electric detonators used in wireline and electronic firing-head perforating operations, which are immune to radio interference and thus cannot be accidentally triggered by radio transmissions.",radio safe detonator
Drilling,"Another term for coiled tubing, a long, continuous length of pipe wound on a spool. The pipe is straightened prior to pushing into a wellbore and rewound to coil the pipe back onto the transport and storage spool. Depending on the pipe diameter (1 in. to 4 1/2 in.) and the spool size, coiled tubing can range from 2,000 ft to 15,000 ft [610 to 4,570 m] or greater length.",reeled tubing
Well Workover and Intervention,"A generic term relating to the use of a coiled tubing string and associated equipment. As a well-intervention method, coiled tubing techniques offer several key benefits over alternative well-intervention technologies. The ability to work safely under live well conditions, with a continuous string, enables fluids to be pumped at any time regardless of the position or direction of travel. This is a significant advantage in many applications. Installing an electrical conductor or hydraulic conduit further enhances the capability of a coiled tubing string and enables relatively complex intervention techniques to be applied safely.",reeled tubing
Formation Evaluation,"The ability of a material to resist electrical conduction. It is the inverse of conductivity and is measured in ohm-m. The resistivity is a property of the material, whereas the resistance also depends on the volume measured. The two are related by a system constant, which in simple cases is the length between the measurement electrodes divided by the area. In the general case, the resistivity is the electric field divided by the current density and depends on the frequency of the applied signal.",resistivity
Reservoir Characterization,A set of characteristics that several rocks have in common. The characteristics of interest are usually those pertaining to fluid movement and fluid storage capacity.,rock types
Perforating,"A procedure imposed during perforating operations in which radios at or near the wellsite are switched off to prevent accidental detonation of perforating guns. Radio silence is required for wireline operations when using a non-radio-safe detonator. It is typically imposed when rigging up perforating guns and until the guns have been run in the hole to 200 ft [61 m] below ground level or mud line. Radio silence is imposed again when retrieving the gun system as it passes the 200-ft mark. Radio silence must be maintained until it has been confirmed that all charges have been shot. This practice is not required when radio-safe detonators are used, but is common practice at many wellsites.",radio silence
Formation Evaluation,"The position on a logging tool string that is used as the reference for depth measurements. Each measurement has a different measure point. In normal practice, each measurement is shifted in depth by the distance between the measure point and the reference point. This ensures that all measurements are recorded at the same depth. For a wireline tool, the reference point is normally the bottom of the tool string. For measurements-while-drilling, the reference is the bit (the driller's depth). The term is sometimes used to mean the depth reference.",reference point
Formation Evaluation,"The ratio of the true resistivity to the resistivity of the same rock filled with water. The resistivity index can be expressed as I = Rt / Ro, where Ro is the water filled resistivity and Rt is the true resistivity. It is related to the water saturation by the saturation exponent, n (I = Sw-n), and is a key component of the Archie equation.",resistivity index
Production Testing,"A component of a production-logging tool that carries a radioactive solution (often carnotite) that can be selectively released into a flow stream. When the radioactive solution is released into an injected fluid, the movement of the mixture can be traced by gamma ray detectors located in the tool. Radioactive tracers are generally used in injection wells rather than in production wells to avoid radioactive contamination at the surface. The main applications of radioactive tracers include establishing flow profiles in injection wells, detecting fluid movements behind the pipe, and locating leaking packers and fluid movement between wells.",radioactive tracer
Geophysics,"Generally, the return or rebound of particles or energy from the interface between two media. There are two laws of reflection, which state (1) that incident rays, reflected rays and the normal to the reflecting interface at the point of incidence are coplanar, and (2) that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. In geophysics, reflection refers to the seismic energy or signal that returns from an interface of contrasting acoustic impedance, known as a reflector, according to Snell's law. Reflection seismic surveys are useful for mapping geologic structures in the subsurface, interpreting sedimentary environments and evaluating hydrocarbon accumulations that might occur as amplitude anomalies. Reflection surveys are complicated by the variation of velocity as well as the various types of wave energy that are propagated within the Earth. In electromagnetics, variation in electrical properties produces reflections.",reflection
Formation Evaluation,"A log of the resistivity of the formation, expressed in ohm-m. The resistivity can take a wide range of values, and, therefore, for convenience is usually presented on a logarithmic scale from, for example, 0.2 to 2000 ohm-m. The resistivity log is fundamental in formation evaluation because hydrocarbons do not conduct electricity while all formation waters do. Therefore a large difference exists between the resistivity of rocks filled with hydrocarbons and those filled with formation water. Clay minerals and a few other minerals, such as pyrite, also conduct electricity, and reduce the difference. Some measurement devices, such as induction and propagation resistivity logs, may respond more directly to conductivity, but are presented in resistivity.",resistivity log
Formation Evaluation,"A log of the resistivity of the formation made by an electrode device such as a laterolog. In this sense the term is used to distinguish the log from an induction measurement, which responds more directly to conductivity.",resistivity log
Production Logging,"A record of the presence of tracer material placed in or around the borehole to measure fluid movement in injection wells. There are two traditional techniques for recording radioactive-tracer logs: the tracer-loss measurement, in which a tracer material is added to the completion fluid and its progress monitored with a gamma ray tool; and the velocity-shot measurement, in which the tracer is ejected from one part of a production logging tool and its progress monitored by one or more gamma ray detectors farther down the tool. Radioactive-tracer logs are used to determine injection-flow profiles and detect channels or leaks. They may also be used in production wells, but care must be taken to isolate the fluids on surface until the tracer has decayed to safe levels. The tracer is a radioactive isotope that is soluble in water, oil or gas, or else insoluble, as in the bead tracer. Different radioactive elements with distinct energies and lifetimes may be used. Today, for water injection, the most common is a water-soluble iodine tracer that has a half-life of 8.1 days, while for steam injection a gas with krypton is used.",radioactive tracer log
Geophysics,"The ratio of amplitude of the reflected wave to the incident wave, or how much energy is reflected. If the wave has normal incidence, then its reflection coefficient can be expressed as: R = (ρ2V2 − ρ1V1) / (ρ2V2 + ρ1V1), where R = reflection coefficient, whose values range from −1 to +1 ρ1 = density of medium 1 ρ2 = density of medium 2 V1 = velocity of medium 1 V2 = velocity of medium 2. Typical values of R are approximately −1 from water to air, meaning that nearly 100% of the energy is reflected and none is transmitted; ~0.5 from water to rock; and ~0.2 for shale to sand. At non-normal incidence, the reflection coefficient defined as a ratio of amplitudes depends on other parameters, such as the shear velocities, and is described as a function of incident angle by the Zoeppritz equations.",reflection coefficient
Geophysics,"The ability to distinguish between separate points or objects, such as sedimentary sequences in a seismic section. High frequency and short wavelengths provide better vertical and lateral resolution. Seismic processing can greatly affect resolution: deconvolution can improve vertical resolution by producing a broad bandwidth with high frequencies and a relatively compressed wavelet. Migration can improve lateral resolution by reducing the size of the Fresnel zone.",resolution

Formation Evaluation,"Relating to two or more logging measurements that have the same response. The term normally refers to vertical resolution, but could also be used for azimuthal or radial resolution.

Geophysics,"The change in the direction of travel of a wavefront, or the bending of a ray, as it passes from one medium to another, expressed mathematically by Snell's law. Refraction is a consequence of changes in wavelength and velocity of propagation of a wave produced by differences in refractive indices of the media. Refraction surveys where the incident and reflected angles are critical can be useful for evaluating increasing velocity gradients and locating features that have anomalously high velocities, such as a salt dome within surrounding rocks of lower velocities.",refraction
Well Completions,A chemical additive used to increase the thickening time of cement slurries or similar fluids that may have a limited pumping time.

The procedure is also used to mix chemicals before a stimulation treatment of an oil or gas well.",roll a tank
Formation Evaluation,"A distance that characterizes how far a logging tool measures into the formation from the axis of the tool or borehole. The term is similar to depth of investigation, but is more appropriate for certain azimuthally symmetric measurements, mainly resistivity. The radius of investigation summarizes the radial response of the measurement in one or more distances, and should be associated with the percentage of signal received from within that depth, typically either 50% or 90%. Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content. The radius of investigation can vary considerably in inhomogeneous conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. It should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response.",radius of investigation
Well Testing,"The calculated maximum radius in a formation in which pressure has been affected during the flow period of a transient well test. While not absolutely accurate, the value has meaning in relation to the total volume of reservoir that is represented by calculated reservoir parameters, such as kh, the permeability thickness. This may also be termed transient drainage radius.",radius of investigation

Drilling,"A device that can be used to quickly seal the top of the well in the event of a well control event (kick). A ram blowout preventer (BOP) consists of two halves of a cover for the well that are split down the middle. Large-diameter hydraulic cylinders, normally retracted, force the two halves of the cover together in the middle to seal the wellbore. These covers are constructed of steel for strength and fitted with elastomer components on the sealing surfaces. The halves of the covers, formally called ram blocks, are available in a variety of configurations. In some designs, they are flat at the mating surfaces to enable them to seal over an open wellbore. Other designs have a circular cutout in the middle that corresponds to the diameter of the pipe in the hole to seal the well when pipe is in the hole. These pipe rams effectively seal a limited range of pipe diameters. Variable-bore rams are designed to seal a wider range of pipe diameters, albeit at a sacrifice of other design criteria, notably element life and hang-off weight. Still other ram blocks are fitted with a tool steel-cutting surface to enable the ram BOPs to completely shear through drillpipe, hang the drillstring off on the ram blocks themselves and seal the wellbore. Obviously, such an action limits future options and is employed only as a last resort to regain pressure control of the wellbore. The various ram blocks can be changed in the ram preventers, enabling the well team to optimize BOP configuration for the particular hole section or operation in progress.",ram blowout preventer

Retort devices are available in three sizes, 10-, 20- and 50-cm3 , which are the volumes of mud placed in the retort sample cup. Data from the test are volume percent water, oil and retort solids.",retort
Drilling,"A tool designed to crush rock efficiently while incurring a minimal amount of wear on the cutting surfaces. Invented by Howard Hughes, the roller-cone bit has conical cutters or cones that have spiked teeth around them. As the drillstring is rotated, the bit cones roll along the bottom of the hole in a circle. As they roll, new teeth come in contact with the bottom of the hole, crushing the rock immediately below and around the bit tooth. As the cone rolls, the tooth then lifts off the bottom of the hole and a high-velocity fluid jet strikes the crushed rock chips to remove them from the bottom of the hole and up the annulus. As this occurs, another tooth makes contact with the bottom of the hole and creates new rock chips. Thus, the process of chipping the rock and removing the small rock chips with the fluid jets is continuous. The teeth intermesh on the cones, which helps clean the cones and enables larger teeth to be used. There are two main types of roller-cone bits, steel milled-tooth bits and carbide insert bits.",roller cone bit
Well Workover and Intervention,"A classification of blowout preventer in which the pressure-control functions are achieved through the operation of hydraulically operated ram sets.

Ram preventers are commonly available in single-, double-, triple- and quad-ram configurations.",ram preventer
Shale Gas,"An operation to restimulate a well after an initial period of production. Refracturing operations attempt to bypass near-wellbore damage, reestablish good connectivity with the reservoir, and tap portions of the reservoir with higher pore pressure. Refracturing operations are also performed after a period of production that can alter the stresses in a reservoir due to depletion; the restimulation can allow the new fracture to reorient along a different azimuth. A successful refracturing operation restores well productivity to near original or even higher rates of production and extends the productive life of a well.",refracturing
Formation Evaluation,"A technique for measuring the fluid saturations in a core sample by heating the sample and measuring the volumes of water and oil driven off. The sample is crushed and weighed before being placed in the retort. It is then heated in stages or directly to 650oC [1200oF] during which the fluids are vaporized, collected, condensed and separated. Plateaus in the rise of the cumulative water volume with temperature are sometimes analyzed to indicate when free water, surface clay-bound water and interlayer clay-bound water have been driven off. The volumes of water and oil are measured directly, but corrections are needed to account for alterations in the oil. The volume of gas also is needed for accurate results. This is measured on a separate, adjacent sample by injecting mercury under pressure and measuring the volume absorbed. Before injection, the sample is weighed and its bulk volume determined by mercury displacement. The total pore volume is then the sum of the volumes of gas, oil and water. The saturation of each component is the ratio of its volume to the total pore volume.",retort method
Well Workover and Intervention,"A downhole tool used on slickline operations conducted on a deviated wellbore to provide additional mass to the tool string.

For calculations, retort solids are normally assumed to be only suspended and dissolved solids, as in the equation below. Volume percent suspended solids (weighting material plus drill solids) is of particular interest to mud engineers. To calculate that percentage, the volume increase caused by the dissolved salts is determined from filtrate analyses of chloride and calcium ions. For oil muds, the calculations are more complicated.",retort solids
Geophysics,"Disturbances in seismic data that are not coherent (they lack a phase relationship between adjacent traces, unlike air waves and ground roll) and cannot be correlated to the seismic energy source.

Retort solids is the volume that was not recovered as a liquid. Three sizes of retort apparatus are available: 10-, 20- and 50-cm3 mud sample size. Some designs have a small oven in the carrying case to heat the sample (the preferred method for oil muds) while others use a blade heater that goes into the mud sample. Retorts should be heated to around 700°F [371°C] to be effective.",retort test
Drilling Fluids,"A mud test in which the mud sample is mildly agitated by rolling (or tumbling) for the duration of the test, usually performed at a selected high temperature. Typically, the mud sample is sealed in a mud-aging cell and placed in an oven that will roll (or tumble) the mud cells continually for a given period of time (often 16 hours or overnight).

Geology,"The approximate age determination of rocks, fossils or minerals made by comparing whether the material is younger or older than other surrounding material. Relative age is estimated according to stratigraphic and structural relationships, such as superposition, and by fossil content, since the relative ages and successions of fossils have been established by paleontologists. The measurement of the decay of radioactive isotopes, especially uranium, rubidium, argon and carbon, has allowed geologists to more precisely determine the age in years of rock formations, known as the absolute age. Tree rings and seasonal sedimentary deposits called varves can be counted to determine absolute age. Although the term implies otherwise, absolute ages typically have some amount of potential error and are inexact.",relative age

Well Testing,"Skin effect with a magnitude that depends on the flow rate of the wellbore fluid. It is caused by non-Darcy flow, fluid flow that deviates from Darcy's law, which assumes laminar flow in the formation. Non-Darcy flow is typically observed in high-rate gas wells when the flow converging to the wellbore reaches flow velocities exceeding the Reynolds number for laminar or Darcy flow, and results in turbulent flow. Since most of the turbulent flow takes place near the wellbore in producing formations, the effect of non-Darcy flow is a rate-dependent skin effect.",rate dependent skin effect

Remaining oil saturation has no petrophysical significance beyond an assessment of the amount of oil remaining in the rock. Considered a snapshot of the reservoir, this assessment depends on the location in the reservoir and time of the measurement. This saturation is measured without regard to the displacement process or processes that produced it.

Drilling Fluids,"Quantity that is double the filtrate volume collected from a filtration test between 7.5 to 30 minutes. This ignores the spurt of filtrate that comes out of the filter press before a cake is established. Relative filtrate volume is used to evaluate certain mud materials. Relative filtrate volume can be expressed as Vrel, = (V30 - V7.5) x 2. Static filtration theory holds that filtrate volume increases as the square root of time. Thus, the volume from 0 to 7.5 minutes should be the same as from 7.5 to 30 minutes in the case of no spurt loss in the first interval. Because spurt often occurs in the 0 to 7.5 minutes, those data can be ignored by doubling the volume in the second interval.

Lost returns is the situation in which some or all of the mud does not come back to the surface, which indicates that mud is being lost into weak, fractured or vugular formations downhole.",returns
Drilling,"Another term for kelly bushing, an adapter that serves to connect the rotary table to the kelly. The kelly bushing has an inside diameter profile that matches that of the kelly, usually square or hexagonal. It is connected to the rotary table by four large steel pins that fit into mating holes in the rotary table. The rotary motion from the rotary table is transmitted to the bushing through the pins, and then to the kelly itself through the square or hexagonal flat surfaces between the kelly and the kelly bushing. The kelly then turns the entire drillstring because it is screwed into the top of the drillstring itself. Depth measurements are commonly referenced to the KB, such as 8327 ft KB, meaning 8327 feet below the kelly bushing.",rotary bushing
Drilling Fluids,"The velocity gradient measured across the diameter of a fluid-flow channel, be it a pipe, annulus or other shape. Shear rate is the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer. As an example, consider that a fluid is placed between two parallel plates that are 1.0 cm apart, the upper plate moving at a velocity of 1.0 cm/sec and the lower plate fixed. The fluid layer at the lower plate is not moving and the layer nearest the top plate is moving at 1.0 cm/sec. Halfway between the plate, a layer is moving at 0.5 cm/sec. The velocity gradient is the rate of change of velocity with distance from the plates. This simple case shows the uniform velocity gradient with shear rate (v1 - v2)/h = shear rate = (cm/sec)/(cm/1) = 1/sec. Hence, shear rate units are reciprocal seconds.",rate of shear
Drilling Fluids,"The water content of air compared to the water content that the air could hold if it were saturated, expressed as a percentage. Air in equilibrium with fresh water is saturated with water vapor, so its RH = 100%. Air above a saturated NaCl solution has RH = 75%. Air above a saturated CaCl2 solution has RH = 31%. RH can, therefore, be used as an indicator of the water activity of a solution with which air is in equilibrium. RH can also reflect the aqueous-phase activity of an oil-emulsion mud, the basis for the Chenevert Method for testing oil muds.",relative humidity
Well Completions,"A downhole tool that is designed to enable communication between the tubing internal diameter and the annulus, typically for reverse circulation purposes, although conventional circulation often can also be undertaken. The valve design may be simple, enabling circulation without the ability to reset the tool until it is retrieved to surface, or be of a more complex design allowing several cycles between open and closed positions.",reverse circulating valve
Drilling,"A method of making hole that relies on continuous circular motion of the bit to break rock at the bottom of the hole. This method, made popular after the discovery of the East Texas Field by Dad Joiner in 1930, is much more efficient than the alternative, cable tool drilling. Rotary drilling is a nearly continuous process, because cuttings are removed as drilling fluids circulate through the bit and up the wellbore to the surface. Cable tool operations are discontinuous and cuttings removal is inefficient. This difference in efficiency becomes particularly significant as hole depth increases.",rotary drilling
Geology,"A dimensionless term devised to adapt the Darcy equation to multiphase flow conditions. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability of that fluid at total saturation. If a single fluid is present in a rock, its relative permeability is 1.0. Calculation of relative permeability allows comparison of the different abilities of fluids to flow in the presence of each other, since the presence of more than one fluid generally inhibits flow.",relative permeability
Well Completions,"A measurement of the ability of two or more fluid phases to pass through a formation matrix. The relative permeability reflects the capability of a specific formation to produce a combination of oil, water or gas more accurately than the absolute permeability of a formation sample, which is measured with a single-phase fluid, usually water.",relative permeability
Drilling,"The intentional pumping of wellbore fluids down the annulus and back up through the drillpipe. This is the opposite of the normal direction of fluid circulation in a wellbore. Since the inside volume of the drillpipe is considerably less than the volume of the annulus outside of the drillpipe, reverse circulation can bring bottomhole fluids to the surface faster than normal circulation for a given flow rate. Two potential hazards of reverse circulation include lifting cuttings and other junk into the drillstring and the rapid flow of reservoir fluids to the surface in a kick situation.",reverse circulation
Well Completions,"To circulate fluid down the wellbore annulus, with returns being made up the tubing string.

The logging tool string may be as much as 120 ft [36.5 m] in length, so the rathole allows tools at the top of the logging string to reach and measure the deepest zone of interest. In addition, there is usually a small amount of extra hole drilled to allow for junk, hole fill-in and other conditions that may reduce the effective depth of the well prior to running logging tools.",rathole

Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement, the characteristic time for a loss of coherent energy, or relaxation, by protons in rocks. There are two types of relaxation: longitudinal relaxation, which is the time (T1) needed to align protons in a static magnetic field; and transverse relaxation, which is the time (T2) needed for protons to lose their coherent energy in an NMR measurement. Relaxations are exponential decays, for which T1 and T2 are the time constants. Different mechanisms contribute to T1 and T2. Surface relaxation and bulk relaxation contribute to both T1 and T2. Surface, bulk and diffusion relaxation contribute to T2.",relaxation time
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Heavy Oil,A type of in-situ combustion in which the burning front moves in an opposite direction to the injected air. Initially, air is injected into a production well and the fire is ignited. After the burning front has advanced some distance from the production well, air is supplied only near the injection well. The burning front advances toward the injection well while the oil moves toward the production well. Reverse combustion actually refers to dry reverse combustion and can be used to recover extremely viscous oil or tar. In reverse combustion, the liquid blocking problem is solved because a hot zone is maintained near the production well. Despite this advantage, this process is not as efficient as dry forward combustion because lighter fractions of the oil are burned and heavier fractions are left behind the burning front. Another drawback is the possibility of a spontaneous ignition in the injector well, which will divert air for combustion near the injector well instead of near the producer.",reverse combustion
Drilling," Shale Gas,A tool designed to drill directionally with continuous rotation from the surface, eliminating the need to slide a steerable motor. Rotary steerable systems typically are deployed when drilling directional, horizontal, or extended-reach wells. State-of-the-art rotary steerable systems have minimal interaction with the borehole, thereby preserving borehole quality. The most advanced systems exert consistent side force similar to traditional stabilizers that rotate with the drillstring or orient the bit in the desired direction while continuously rotating at the same number of rotations per minute as the drillstring.",rotary steerable system

Drilling,"The revolving or spinning section of the drillfloor that provides power to turn the drillstring in a clockwise direction (as viewed from above). The rotary motion and power are transmitted through the kelly bushing and the kelly to the drillstring. When the drillstring is rotating, the drilling crew commonly describes the operation as simply, rotating to the right, turning to the right, or, rotating on bottom. Almost all rigs today have a rotary table, either as primary or backup system for rotating the drillstring.

Drilling,"The complete operation of removing the drillstring from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. After some preliminary preparations for the trip, the rig crew removes the drillstring 90 ft [27 m] at a time, by unscrewing every third drillpipe or drill collar connection. When the three joints are unscrewed from the rest of the drillstring, they are carefully stored upright in the derrick by the fingerboards at the top and careful placement on wooden planks on the rig floor. After the drillstring has been removed from the wellbore, the dull bit is unscrewed with the use of a bit breaker and quickly examined to determine why the bit dulled or failed. Depending on the failure mechanism, the crew might choose a different type of bit for the next section. If the bearings on the prior bit failed, but the cutting structures are still sharp and intact, the crew may opt for a faster drilling (less durable) cutting structure. Conversely, if the bit teeth are worn out but the bearings are still sealed and functioning, the crew should choose a bit with more durable (and less aggressive) cutting structures. Once the bit is chosen, it is screwed onto the bottom of the drill collars with the help of the bit breaker, the drill collars are run into the hole (RIH), and the drillpipe is run in the hole. Once on bottom, drilling commences again. The duration of this operation depends on the total depth of the well and the skill of the rig crew. A general estimate for a competent crew is that the round trip requires one hour per thousand feet of hole, plus an hour or two for handling collars and bits. At that rate, a round trip in a ten thousand-foot well might take twelve hours. A round trip for a 30,000-ft [9230 m] well might take 32 or more hours, especially if intermediate hole-cleaning operations must be undertaken.",round trip

The power-law fluid model parameters, exponent (n) and consistency (k), apply to polymer muds, although the three-parameter Herschel-Bulkley model is a better fit to polymer muds.

Offshore, the rig includes the same components as onshore, but not those of the vessel or drilling platform itself. The rig is sometimes referred to as the drilling package, particularly offshore.",rig
Well Workover and Intervention,"A cement-squeeze technique in which the cement slurry is continuously injected until the desired squeeze pressure is achieved. When pumping stops, the final squeeze pressure is monitored. If the pressure falls, additional slurry is squeezed to increase the pressure back to the final squeeze value. This process is repeated until the final squeeze pressure can be sustained.",running squeeze
Formation Evaluation,"Also called camera, the device used in early logging to record logging measurements on photographic film. The camera consisted of a light shining on galvanometers, which reflected the light to produce a trace on one or more films. The galvanometers deflected according to the log measurement to give the log reading. The films were turned by the depth wheel, which gave the depth axis of the log.",recorder
Shale Gas,"A model of a specific volume of the subsurface that incorporates all the geologic characteristics of the reservoir. Such models are used to quantify characteristics within the subsurface volume that are relatively stable over long periods of time and can, therefore, be considered static. These attributes include the structural shape and thicknesses of the formations within the subsurface volume being modeled, their lithologies, and the porosity and permeability distributions. These last two characteristics often vary significantly from location to location within the volume, resulting in heterogeneity. However, porosity and permeability are stable in the near-geologic timeframe and do not change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. The result of reservoir characterization is a reservoir characterization model (also known as a static model and sometimes referred to as a geologic model). Shale gas reservoir rocks require the analysis of high-quality seismic data, core, and log measurements and engineering data to produce an accurate reservoir characterization model. This model is then used as input into reservoir simulation, during which reservoir engineers add other reservoir characteristics, such as pressures, temperatures, and fluid and gas compositions. These features can change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. Since these are dynamic in their nature over short timeframes, once production is initiated these models are referred to as dynamic models. Thorough reservoir simulations (dynamic models) that are based on accurately developed reservoir characterizations (static models) can be of significant value in optimizing well placement and field-development planning.",reservoir characterization model

Drilling,"The primary and probably most important device on the rig for removing drilled solids from the mud. This vibrating sieve is simple in concept, but a bit more complicated to use efficiently. A wire-cloth screen vibrates while the drilling fluid flows on top of it. The liquid phase of the mud and solids smaller than the wire mesh pass through the screen, while larger solids are retained on the screen and eventually fall off the back of the device and are discarded. Obviously, smaller openings in the screen clean more solids from the whole mud, but there is a corresponding decrease in flow rate per unit area of wire cloth. Hence, the drilling crew should seek to run the screens (as the wire cloth is called), as fine as possible, without dumping whole mud off the back of the shaker. Where it was once common for drilling rigs to have only one or two shale shakers, modern high-efficiency rigs are often fitted with four or more shakers, thus giving more area of wire cloth to use, and giving the crew the flexibility to run increasingly fine screens.",shale shaker

Geology," Shale Gas,Containing shale, a fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps. Gas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",shaly
Drilling Fluids,"Containing shale, a fine-grained, impermeable, sedimentary rock composed of clays and other minerals, usually with a high percentage of quartz. Shale is the most common, and certainly the most troublesome, rock type that must be drilled in order to reach oil and gas deposits. The characteristic that makes shales most troublesome to drillers is its water sensitivity, due in part to its clay content and the ionic composition of the clay. For this reason, oil-base drilling fluids are the mud of choice to drill the most water-sensitive shales.",shaly
Drilling,"To put drillpipe into the wellbore when the blowout preventers (BOPs) are closed and pressure is contained in the well. Snubbing is necessary when a kick is taken, since well kill operations should always be conducted with the drillstring on bottom, and not somewhere up the wellbore. If only the annular BOP has been closed, the drillpipe may be slowly and carefully lowered into the wellbore, and the BOP itself will open slightly to permit the larger diameter tool joints to pass through. If the well has been closed with the use of ram BOPs, the tool joints will not pass by the closed ram element. Hence, while keeping the well closed with either another ram BOP or the annular BOP, the ram must be opened manually, then the pipe lowered until the tool joint is just below the ram, and then closing the ram again. This procedure is repeated whenever a tool joint must pass by a ram BOP. In snubbing operations, the pressure in the wellbore acting on the cross-sectional area of the tubular can exert sufficient force to overcome the weight of the drillstring, so the string must be pushed (or snubbed) back into the wellbore. In ordinary stripping operations, the pipe falls into the wellbore under its own weight, and no additional downward force or pushing is required.",snub

Formation Evaluation,"The irregular movement of a logging tool up a well due to it being stuck at some point and then being released. In normal operation, the cable is pulled smoothly out of the well and the logging tool follows. However, the tool can become stuck by differential pressure or an irregular hole. The cable stretches, and its tension increases, until the tool is freed. At this point it moves, or slips, quickly up the hole until the normal movement is resumed. Since the depth measurement is driven by the cable, the log readings opposite a zone of stick and slip are displayed at incorrect depths. Furthermore, since each measurement has a different measure point, the zone of stick and slip shows up at a different depth on each measurement.",stick and slip
Drilling,"A weak spot in the drillstring. Such a weak spot sometimes is intentionally put into the drillstring so that if tension in the drillstring exceeds a predetermined amount, the safety joint will part and the rest of the drillstring will be salvageable.

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Well Completions, Well Workover and Intervention, Shale Gas,A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments.

Drilling Fluids,"The velocity gradient measured across the diameter of a fluid-flow channel, be it a pipe, annulus or other shape. Shear rate is the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer. As an example, consider that a fluid is placed between two parallel plates that are 1.0 cm apart, the upper plate moving at a velocity of 1.0 cm/sec and the lower plate fixed. The fluid layer at the lower plate is not moving and the layer nearest the top plate is moving at 1.0 cm/sec. Halfway between the plate, a layer is moving at 0.5 cm/sec. The velocity gradient is the rate of change of velocity with distance from the plates. This simple case shows the uniform velocity gradient with shear rate (v1 - v2)/h = shear rate = (cm/sec)/(cm/1) = 1/sec. Hence, shear rate units are reciprocal seconds.",shear rate

Their solutions are buffers in the 4.6 to 12 pH range. TSP is an excellent degreaser. All will precipitate hardness ions such as calcium. Polyphosphates are polymers made from various orthophosphates by dehydration with heat. Sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) is a clay deflocculant and treatment for cement contamination. For clay deflocculation, polyphosphates are limited by the temperature at which they hydrolyze back to orthophosphates, although several that performed up to 280°F [138°C] have been documented in the literature (see reference).

Formation Evaluation,"The ability of fluid to move through a rock, as measured by the reduction in amplitude or increase in slowness of the acoustic Stoneley wave generated in the borehole. The velocity and amplitude of the Stoneley wave are reduced by the presence of mobile fluids in the formation. Physically, the effect can be seen as a coupling of the Stoneley energy into a formation wave known as the slow wave, as predicted by the Biot theory. The amount of reduction is a complicated function of this mobility (or permeability divided by viscosity), the properties of the borehole fluid, the pore fluid and the mudcake, the elastic properties of the rock and the frequency. Since all these factors are measured or estimated from logs, it is possible to determine formation mobility. In practice, the mobility needs to be reasonably high for the method to be accurate.",Stoneley permeability
Drilling Fluids,"A test procedure published by the API that specifies the use of a shearometer tube and a set of weights to measure the shear strength of a mud (lbf/100 ft2 or kPa). The typical use for this test is for evaluation of a static-aged mud sample left at high temperature for several hours. The shear tube is placed on the surface of the gelled mud and weights are applied until the tube sinks to a marked depth. The applied weight indicates shear strength of the mud sample.Reference:Watkins TE and Nelson ME: High Temperature Gellation of Drilling Fluids, Transactions of the AIME 193 (1953): 213-218.",shear strength measurement test
Drilling Fluids,"Made by neutralizing a linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+, with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Sodium polyacrylate is often abbreviated to SPA. Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup. The polymer chain links together colloidal solids that can be removed by gravity settling in shallow pits or by applying hydrocyclone, centrifuge or filtration techniques.",sodium polyacrylate
Geophysics,"A type of large-amplitude interface, or surface, wave generated by a sonic tool in a borehole. Stoneley waves can propagate along a solid-fluid interface, such as along the walls of a fluid-filled borehole and are the main low-frequency component of signal generated by sonic sources in boreholes. Analysis of Stoneley waves can allow estimation of the locations of fractures and permeability of the formation. Stoneley waves are a major source of noise in vertical seismic profiles.",Stoneley wave
Drilling Fluids,"An influx of formation water, usually salty and sometimes hard, into the mud in the wellbore. Saltwater flows contaminate freshwater or seawater muds, making it expensive, difficult and time-consuming to regain the mud properties. Influxes pose a lesser problem for saltwater muds. Saltwater contamination flocculates the bentonite clay in fresh- or seawater muds.

Drilling,"A pulley. In oilfield usage, the term usually refers to either the pulleys permanently mounted on the top of the rig (the crown blocks), or the pulleys used for running wireline tools into the wellbore. In the case of the crown blocks, the drilling line, a heavy wire rope, is threaded between the crown blocks and the traveling blocks in a block and tackle arrangement to gain mechanical advantage. A relatively weak drilling line, with a breaking strength of perhaps 100,000 pounds [45,400 kg], may be used to lift much larger loads, perhaps in excess of one million pounds [454,000 kg]. During wireline operations, two sheaves are temporarily hung in the derrick, and the wireline is run from the logging truck through the sheaves and then down to the logging tool in the wellbore.",sheave
Drilling Fluids,"Formed by dissolving silica or silicate minerals in NaOH solutions. The silicate anion, SiO4-4, is found in solutions of sodium silicate. Silicate anions form polysilicates, or colloidal silica gel. A silicate mud is a type of shale-inhibitive water base drilling fluid that contains sodium silicate or potassium silicate polymeric ions. These ions adsorb on the shale surface and form a semipermeable osmotic membrane that prevents the transport of water and ions internal to the shale structure. This physicochemical barrier helps improve wellbore stability and provides in-gauge holes through troublesome shale sections that otherwise might require a nonaqueous drilling fluid. Silicate-gel drilling muds were first used in the 1930s to control problematic shales. In the 1990s, silicate nondispersed polymer drilling fluids were reintroduced to provide a high-performance shale-inhibitive water-base fluid, as an alternative to oil-base fluids. The highly inhibitive silicate fluid not only provides wellbore stability but also improves solids control performance with minimal environmental impact.",sodium silicate

Drilling Fluids,"A water mud containing varying amounts of dissolved sodium chloride, NaCl, as a major component. Undissolved salt may also be present in saturated salt muds to increase density beyond 10 lbm/gal or to act as a bridging agent over permeable zones. Starch and starch derivatives for fluid-loss control and xanthan gums for hole-cleaning are among the few highly effective additives for saltwater muds. Attapulgite and sepiolite are used in saltwater muds only for cuttings lifting. The primary use of saltwater mud is to drill salt strata that are prone to dissolution when exposed to other types of drilling fluid. A saturated salt mud is used to drill salt to prevent hole enlargement. In hot, plastic, salt zones, the hole may close inward unless extremely high mud weight is maintained. As an alternative to high mud weight, maintaining undersaturation in the fluid allows controlled leaching to offset hole closure by plastic flow. Sized salt particles in saturated saltwater muds are used, along with polymers, to bridge over permeable production zones. The salt can be removed later with a water flush. Salt solids can increase density beyond 10 lbm/gal, up to about 13 lbm/gal, if needed.",saltwater mud

Two types of sheen tests are mandated by EPA under NPDES permits. The visual sheen test consists of an observation made when surface and atmospheric conditions permit watching the ocean water for a sheen around the point where the discharge entered the water. When the conditions do not permit visual observations, a static sheen test is mandated by NPDES permits and the protocol published by US EPA. This test uses sea water in a shallow pan (not more than 30 cm deep) with 1000 cm2 surface area. Either 15 cm3 of fresh mud or 15 g fresh cuttings are injected below the surface of the water.

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for recording the formation compressional slowness based on the transit time between transmitter and receiver. In the most basic wireline sonic measurement, an acoustic transducer emits a sonic signal, of between about 10 and 30 kHz, which is detected at two receivers farther up the hole. The time between emission and reception is measured for each receiver, and subtracted to give the traveltime in the interval between the two receivers. If the receivers are two feet apart, then this time is divided by two to give the interval transit time, or slowness, of the formation. This type of measurement is also known as first motion detection. This technique works because the first arrival at the receiver is a wave that has traveled from the transmitter to the borehole wall, where it has generated a compressional wave in the formation. Some of this wave is critically refracted up the borehole wall, generating head waves in the borehole fluid as it progresses. Some of these strike the receiver, arriving in most cases well before any signal traveling directly through the mud. Furthermore, if the logging tool is parallel to the borehole wall, the traveltime in the mud is cancelled by taking the difference between the traveltime to the two receivers. Problems of irregular hole or a tilted tool are avoided by using borehole compensation. The depth of investigation depends on the slowness, the transmitter-to-receiver spacing and the presence or absence of an altered zone. It is generally within the invaded zone, and of the order of several inches.",sonic measurement

Geology,"The range of sedimentary grain sizes that occurs in sediment or sedimentary rock. The term also refers to the process by which sediments of similar size are naturally segregated during transport and deposition according to the velocity and transporting medium. Well-sorted sediments are of similar size (such as desert sand), while poorly-sorted sediments have a wide range of grain sizes (as in a glacial till). A well-sorted sandstone tends to have greater porosity than a poorly sorted sandstone because of the lack of grains small enough to fill its pores.

Such tests are performed under controlled environmental conditions and duration. Bioassay tests of drilling fluids are required by governmental agencies throughout the world prior to discharge of mud or cuttings. The organisms used in bioassays are those found in the area that would be most affected by contact with the proposed drilling fluid. The dosage of interest is typically the lethal concentration, known as LC50, that will kill 50% of the population of organisms in a given period of time. Chronic bioassay tests indicate sublethal effects, such as changes in growth or reproduction of the organism over a longer period of time.",shrimp test

Drilling Fluids,"A form of corrosion in which susceptible types of metals will break by a combination of stress within the metal and the specific type of corrosion. Sulfide corrosion of ferrous alloys and chloride corrosion of stainless steels are two common type of SCC. When high-strength steel remains in contact with hydrogen sulfide (or sulfide ion) in a water-mud environment, sulfide SCC may occur. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible to brittle failure caused by sulfide SCC. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH.",stress corrosion cracking

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"The study of and description of sandstones, including the mineral content. In matrix stimulation, only the mineral surfaces contacted by the stimulation fluid will be dissolved, so a petrographic study often helps anticipate the rocks response to fluid injection. Sandstone reservoirs are made of silicate grains such as quartz, feldspar, chert and mica, which are deposited as sand; secondary minerals may be deposited in the original pore spaces. Secondary quartz or carbonate minerals often bind sand grains together. Authigenic clays, mainly composed of silicon and aluminum, may also form in the pores. The reactivity of a given mineral depends on three factors: surface area, chemical composition and temperature.

Fractionation is based on the solubility of hydrocarbon components in various solvents used in this test. Each fraction consists of a solubility class containing a range of different molecular-weight species. In this method, the crude oil is fractionated to four solubility classes, referred to collectively as SARA: saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes. Saturates are generally iso- and cyclo-paraffins, while aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes form a continuum of molecules with increasing molecular weight, aromaticity, and heteroatom contents. Asphaltenes may also contain metals such as nickel and vanadium. This method is sometimes referred to as Asphaltene/Wax/Hydrate Deposition analysis.",SARA analysis

Typical source rocks, usually shales or limestones, contain about 1% organic matter and at least 0.5% total organic carbon (TOC), although a rich source rock might have as much as 10% organic matter. Rocks of marine origin tend to be oil-prone, whereas terrestrial source rocks (such as coal) tend to be gas-prone.

Drilling,"The act of putting drillpipe into the wellbore when the blowout preventers (BOPs) are closed and pressure is contained in the well. This is necessary when a kick is taken, since well kill operations should always be conducted with the drillstring on bottom, and not somewhere up the wellbore. If only the annular BOP has been closed, the drillpipe may be slowly and carefully lowered into the wellbore, and the BOP itself will open slightly to permit the larger diameter tool joints to pass through. If the well has been closed with the use of ram BOPs, the tool joints will not pass by the closed ram element. Hence, while keeping the well closed with either another ram or the annular BOP, the ram must be opened manually, then the pipe lowered until the tool joint is just below the ram, and then the ram closed again. This procedure is repeated whenever a tool joint must pass by a ram BOP. Rig crews are usually required to practice ram-to-ram and ram-to-annular stripping operations as part of their well control certifications. In stripping operations, the combination of the pressure in the well and the weight of the drillstring is such that the pipe falls in the hole under its own weight, whereas in snubbing operations the pipe must be pushed into the hole.",stripping

Formation Evaluation,"An equation for calculating the water saturation from resistivity and other logs. There are many saturation equations. Practical equations are all extensions of the Archie equation, which is valid for a rock with very little clay, or very high salinity water, and with a regular pore structure. The majority deal with the problem of shaly sands, and can be divided into two main groups?those that treat the shale as a volume of conductive material (Vsh models), and those that analyze the effect of clay counter-ions. Vsh models take many forms. Typical examples are the Simandoux, laminated sand and Indonesian equations. The other group includes the Waxman-Smits, Dual Water and SGS equations.

Formation Evaluation,"The exponent, n, in the relation of water saturation, Sw, to resistivity index, I (I = Sw-n) for a sample of rock. It expresses the effect on the resistivity of desaturating the sample, or replacing water with a non-conductive fluid. In petrophysically simple, water-wet rocks (Archie rocks), n is constant for different values of Sw, and a single average n can be found for a particular reservoir or formation. A typical value is 2. In more complex rocks, n changes with Sw, although often being about 2 near Sw = 1. In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, n becomes increasingly lower as Sw is reduced. This change is negligible for high-salinity waters, but increases as the salinity is reduced. In shaly-sand saturation equations, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS and CRMM, n is the intrinsic n, determined with high-salinity water or with the clay effects removed. The variation of I with Sw is then predicted, with varying success, by the different equations. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, n may change as each pore type is desaturated. A different n may be used for a different range of Sw. In all cases, n increases if any pores are oil-wet. Values up to 8 have been reported in very oil-wet rocks.",saturation exponent
Drilling Fluids,"Abbreviation for sodium polyacrylate. SPA is the result of neutralizing a linear, anionic polymer made from the monomer acrylic acid, CH2=CHCOO- H+, with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Polyacrylates are best utilized in soft water with low salinity to achieve the best dispersion and full chain elongation. Even low concentrations of hardness ions, for example, Ca+2, precipitate polyacrylates. Low molecular-weight polyacrylates are used as clay deflocculants. High molecular weight polymers are used for fluid-loss control and as a clay extender. As an extender, SPA is added to bentonite at the grinding plant. It is also used at the rig in low-solids mud. Divalent cations can negate its benefits as a clay extender. SPA is highly efficient when used to flocculate colloids in native-solids muds, clear-water muds and wastewater cleanup. The polymer chain links together colloidal solids that can be removed by gravity settling in shallow pits or by applying hydrocyclone, centrifuge or filtration techniques.",SPA

Drilling,"A short length of drill collar that has male threads on one end and female on the other. It is screwed onto the bottom of the kelly or topdrive and onto the rest of the drillstring. When the hole must be deepened, and pipe added to the drillstring, the threads are unscrewed between the saver sub and the rest of the drillstring, as opposed to between the kelly or topdrive and the saver sub. This means that the connection between the kelly or topdrive and the saver sub rarely is used, and suffers minimal wear and tear, whereas the lower connection is used in almost all cases and suffers the most wear and tear. The saver sub is expendable and does not represent a major investment. However, the kelly or topdrive component threads are spared by use of a saver sub, and those components represent a significant capital cost and considerable downtime when replaced.",saver sub

Drilling,"Any liquid used to physically separate one special-purpose liquid from another. Special-purpose liquids are typically prone to contamination, so a spacer fluid compatible with each is used between the two. The most common spacer is simply water. However, chemicals are usually added to enhance its performance for the particular operation. Spacers are used primarily when changing mud types and to separate mud from cement during cementing operations. In the former, an oil-base fluid must be kept separate from a water-base fluid. In this case, the spacer may be base oil. In the latter operation, a chemically treated water spacer usually separates drilling mud from cement slurry. For proper performance and to prevent unanticipated problems, the spacer should be tested with each fluid in small-scale pilot tests. Some spacer fluids are designed to induce a particular flow regime. Ideally, a cement slurry should have turbulent flow to efficiently displace drilling fluids, but there might be pumping restrictions on fluid velocity. Therefore, a spacer that can achieve turbulent or pseudolaminar flow might be selected.",spacer fluid

Well Completions,"A chemical treatment used to control or prevent scale deposition in the production conduit or completion system. Scale-inhibitor chemicals may be continuously injected through a downhole injection point in the completion, or periodic squeeze treatments may be undertaken to place the inhibitor in the reservoir matrix for subsequent commingling with produced fluids. Some scale-inhibitor systems integrate scale inhibitors and fracture treatments into one step, which guarantees that the entire well is treated with scale inhibitor. In this type of treatment, a high-efficiency scale inhibitor is pumped into the matrix surrounding the fracture face during leakoff. It adsorbs to the matrix during pumping until the fracture begins to produce water. As water passes through the inhibitor-adsorbed zone, it dissolves sufficient inhibitor to prevent scale deposition. The inhibitor is better placed than in a conventional scale-inhibitor squeeze, which reduces the retreatment cost and improves production.",scale inhibitor

Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as that of the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV.",sigma
Formation Evaluation,"The permeability of a porous medium to a specific fluid, when that fluid is the only fluid present. Permeability is defined as a property of the porous medium. However, the permeability measured on samples often depends on the fluid used. For example, liquids can affect the permeability through fines movement and clay alteration; gas permeability depends on slippage and inertial resistance, unless fully corrected for these effects. It is therefore more correct to talk of specific permeability to a particular fluid, although, in practice, the shorter term, permeability, is common.",specific permeability

Sulfide corrosion of ferrous alloys and chloride corrosion of stainless steels are two common type of SCC. When high-strength steel remains in contact with hydrogen sulfide (or sulfide ion) in a water-mud environment, sulfide SCC may occur.

When spherical flow is followed by radial flow, both horizontal and vertical permeability can be quantified.",spherical flow
Geology,"A plate tectonic process in which one lithospheric plate descends beneath another into the asthenosphere during a collision at a convergent plate margin. Because of the relatively higher density of oceanic lithosphere, it will typically descend beneath the lighter continental lithosphere during a collision. In a collision of plates of continental lithosphere, the density of the two plates is so similar that neither tends to be subducted and mountains form. As a subducted plate descends into the asthenosphere, Earthquakes can occur, especially in the Wadati-Benioff zone, but, if the plate descends deeply into the mantle, it will eventually be heated to the point of melting. Volcanoes can form above a descending plate.",subduction

Formation Evaluation,"A technique for focusing an electrode device based on maintaining a spherical equipotential surface centered at the main current electrode. Unlike the laterolog, which tries to maintain equipotential lines parallel to the sonde, spherical focusing tries to maintain the spherical equipotential lines that would exist in a homogeneous formation with no borehole. This is achieved with a particular arrangement of current-emitting electrode, current-return electrodes and monitor electrodes. This arrangement creates two spherical equipotential spheres with a constant voltage drop between them. The resistivity is determined from the current flowing between the spheres and the voltage drop. The depth of investigation is determined by the radii of the two spheres. Spherical focusing is used to produce shallow-reading resistivity logs and the pad-based microspherical log.",spherical focusing

Once on the desired location, this type of structure is slowly flooded until it rests on the seafloor. After the well is completed, the water is pumped out of the buoyancy tanks, the vessel refloated and towed to the next location.

Geology,"An exploration and production play type in which prospects exist below salt layers. Until relatively recently, many explorationists did not seek prospects below salt because seismic data had been of poor quality below salt (i.e., it was not possible to map traps accurately) or because they believed that reservoir-quality rock or hydrocarbons did not exist below salt layers. Advances in seismic processing and compelling drilling results from exploration wells encouraged companies to generate and drill prospects below salt layers, salt sheets and other previously disregarded potential traps.

Drilling Fluids,"A type of shale-inhibitive water base drilling fluid that contains sodium silicate or potassium silicate polymeric ions. These ions adsorb on the shale surface and form a semipermeable osmotic membrane that prevents the transport of water and ions internal to the shale structure. This physicochemical barrier helps improve wellbore stability and provides in-gauge holes through troublesome shale sections that otherwise might require a nonaqueous drilling fluid. Silicate-gel drilling muds were first used in the 1930s to control problematic shales. In the 1990s, silicate nondispersed polymer drilling fluids were reintroduced to provide a high-performance shale-inhibitive water-base fluid, as an alternative to oil-base fluids. The highly inhibitive silicate fluid not only provides wellbore stability but also improves solids control performance with minimal environmental impact.",silicate mud

A scratcher resembles a bottlebrush, but its diameter is greater than its height. Importantly, for scratchers to be effective, the casing must be moved. This movement may be reciprocal motion in and out of the wellbore, rotary motion, or both. In general, the more motion, the better the cement job will be.",scratcher

Production Logging,"A device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well based on the speed of rotation of an impeller, or spinner. The spinner can be helical, that is, longer than it is wide, or like a vane, which is similar to a fan blade. In both cases, the speed of rotation is measured and related to the effective velocity of the fluid. Friction and fluid viscosity cause the relationship to be slightly nonlinear at low effective velocities and introduce a threshold velocity below which the spinner does not turn. Results are interpreted using the multipass, two-pass or single-pass methods. There are several types of spinner flowmeter. The most common device uses a small vane-like spinner, about 1.5 in. [3.8 cm] in diameter, allowing the logging tool to pass through the tubing and other restrictions before reaching the reservoir interval. The small spinner captures only part of the fluid flow in the casing, too little to make it turn in some low flow-rate wells and possibly unrepresentative in multiphase flow settings. Other devices have been designed to capture more of the flow, for example the fullbore spinner and various types of flow-concentrating or diverter spinners, such as the packer flowmeter and the basket flowmeter.",spinner flowmeter

Production Logging,"The change in direction of rotation that occurs when a spinner flowmeter tool is moving in the same direction, but faster, than the fluid. When the tool is stationary, moving against the fluid flow, or moving in the same direction but slower than the flow, it will rotate in one direction, perhaps clockwise. However, if it moves in the same direction, but faster than the fluid, it will rotate counterclockwise.

Drilling,"A length of ordinary steel link chain used by the drilling crew to cause pipe being screwed together to turn rapidly. This is accomplished by first carefully wrapping the chain around the lower half of the tool joint that is hanging off in the slips, stabbing another joint into that one, and then throwing the chain in such a manner that it wraps itself on the new upper joint. At the proper time, the driller must pull tension on the chain while a member of the floor crew holds some tension on the free end of the chain. This causes the new drillpipe joint to act like a spool, and as the driller pulls the chain on one end using the drawworks, the spool (or new pipe joint) turns and screws into the joint hung off in the slips. If the floor crew members are not extremely careful, loose clothing or worse, fingers, may become trapped in the unspooling chain and be severely damaged or cut off. Most rig contractors have discontinued the use of spinning chains because of high accident rates. The chains are still available on the rigs, but are not routinely used, having been replaced with other mechanical spinning devices.",spinning chain

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A standard laboratory instrument to measure interfacial tension. The method is particularly applicable to values of interfacial tension below 1 mN/m and especially below 10-2 mN/m, as may occur when employing surfactants for enhanced oil recovery. The method utilizes a tube containing a drop of the less-dense phase within the more-dense phase. When the tube is spun along its long axis at high speed, the resulting forces center the drop on the tube axis and deform it. The interfacial tension is a function of the shape of the deformed drop, the liquid densities and the rotation speed. Advanced versions of the instrument can periodically vary the rotation rate. The phase lag between the change of rotation rate and the drop deformation can be used to determine both interfacial elasticity and interfacial viscosity.",spinning drop tensiometer

Formation Evaluation,"Another term for corkscrew hole, the result of certain drilling conditions that cause the borehole to take the shape of a corkscrew.

A corkscrew hole affects measurements sensitive to standoff, such as induction and neutron porosity, and may affect pad tools, if they cannot follow the changes.",spiral borehole

Drilling Fluids,"A common anaerobic bacterium, commonly abbreviated SRB, that can convert sulfate ions, SO4-2, into S-2 and HS-, with the concomitant oxidation of a carbon source. The lignite, lignin, tannins, cellulose, starches and fatty acids found in many mud systems are carbon food sources for SRB. Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater. Bacteria accumulation can lead to pitting of steel, and the buildup of H2S increases the corrosiveness of the water, thus increasing the possibility of hydrogen blistering or sulfide stress cracking.",sulfate reducing bacteria

Geophysics,"Naturally occurring (static) electrical potential in the Earth. Spontaneous potentials are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, by the presence of a semipermeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid (salty water) through the rocks. Variations in SP can be measured in the field and in wellbores to determine variations of ionic concentration in pore fluids of rocks.",spontaneous potential
Formation Evaluation,"A log of the natural difference in electrical potential, in millivolts, between an electrode in the borehole and a fixed reference electrode on the surface. The most useful component of this difference is the electrochemical potential since it can cause a significant deflection opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of the deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between drilling mud and formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed. The spontaneous potential (SP) log is therefore used to detect permeable beds and to estimate formation water salinity and formation clay content. The SP log cannot be recorded in nonconductive mud. The SP can be affected by several factors that make interpretation difficult. First, there are other possible sources of electrical potential not related to the electrochemical effect, for example, the electrokinetic potential and bimetallism. Many of these are small and constant throughout the log, and can be lumped together in the shale baseline. Second, the SP can measure only the potential drop in the borehole, and not the full electrochemical potential. The ideal SP opposite a clean bed is known as the static spontaneous potential (SSP), and opposite a shaly bed as the pseudostatic spontaneous potential (PSP). The SP is always less than the SSP or the PSP and more rounded at the boundaries between shales and permeable beds. The SP was first recognized by C. Schlumberger, M. Schlumberger and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Russian oil fields.",spontaneous potential

Production Logging,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using only one logging run over the zone of interest.

However, in highly deviated and horizontal wells, where the logging tools must be deployed using coiled tubing or a tractor, the cost of an additional pass is high. Single-pass interpretation, with improved spinner characterization, has therefore become more common in recent years.",single pass method

Their accumulation constitutes a safety concern at the rig because of the risk of reverting to H2S gas should an acidic influx occur. They may be converted to inert sulfides by adding zinc oxide.Reference:Garrett RL, Carlton LA and Denekas MO: Methods for Field Monitoring of Oil-Based Drilling Fluids for Hydrogen Sulfide and Water Intrusions, SPE Drilling Engineering 3, no.3 (September 1988): 296-302.",sulfide

Drilling Fluids,"A small volume or pill of fluid placed in a wellbore annulus to free differentially stuck pipe. Oil-base mud is the traditional stuck-pipe spotting fluid. Speed in mixing and placing the spot is of primary importance to successfully freeing pipe. Because of concern about mud disposal, spots used offshore are either synthetic-based emulsions or benign water-base formulations. Each type is supplied as prepackaged concentrate designed for rapid access and mixing at the rig. A spot frees pipe by covering the stuck region. It presumably breaks up the filter cake, allowing the spot to migrate into cracks in the cake and between the pipe and the cake, reducing the stuck area and allowing pipe to be pulled free.",spotting fluid
Drilling Fluids,"A chemical that removes all three soluble sulfide species, H2S, S-2 and HS-, and forms a product that is nonhazardous and noncorrosive. Zinc compounds are commonly used to precipitate ZnS and decrease the concentration of all three sulfides that are in equilibrium in a solution to a very low concentration. For water mud, zinc basic carbonate, and, for oil mud, zinc oxide, are recognized to be effective sulfide scavengers. Oxidation of sulfides to form other types of sulfur compounds will remove sulfides from a mud, but slowly and with less certainty.",sulfide scavenger

Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH. Sulfide stress cracking is also called hydrogen sulfide cracking, sulfide cracking, sulfide corrosion cracking and sulfide stress-corrosion cracking. The variation of the name is due to the lack of agreement in the mechanism of failure. Some researchers consider sulfide-stress cracking a type of stress-corrosion cracking, while others consider it a type of hydrogen embrittlement.",sulfide stress cracking

Drilling Fluids,"A quantitative analysis of sulfides in the drilling fluid. Specific test methods have been published by API. The oil-mud procedure analyzes active sulfides and uses whole mud samples, whereas the water-base drilling fluid procedure tests filtrate. The instrument used is called a Garrett gas train (GGT), a clear, plastic block (2.5 in. x 4 in. x 6 in.) that contains three interconnected chambers. A carrier gas is used to flow an inert gas through the chambers. The sample is placed in chamber #1 and is acidified to release sulfides as H2S (and carbonates as CO2). The appropriate Drdger tube is used to measure the effluent gas that is evolved from the sample. The device is named after Bob Garrett, who invented it while at Exxon Production Research.

Drilling Fluids,"A water-base mud designed for offshore drilling whose make-up water is taken from the ocean. Sea water contains relatively low salinity, about 3 to 4 wt. % NaCl, but has a high hardness because of Mg+2 and Ca+2 ions. Hardness is removed from sea water by adding NaOH, which precipitates Mg+2 as Mg(OH)2, and by adding Na2CO3, which removes Ca+2 as CaCO3. Mud additives are the same as those used in freshwater mud-bentonite clay, lignosulfonate, lignite, carboxymethylcellulose or polyanionic cellulose and caustic soda. XC polymer may also be used in place of bentonite. Higher concentrations of each additive are required because of salinity effects.

Formation Evaluation,"An indicator of the porosity that does not contribute to a sonic measurement of interval transit time. The transit time is little affected by vugs, fractures and other irregular events because the sonic wave finds a faster path around them. Spherical pores such as oomolds also have less effect on traveltime than oblate pores. Thus, when the sonic porosity is less than some measurement of the total porosity, the difference can be attributed to the presence of post-depositional, or secondary, porosity. The sonic porosity is usually derived from the Wyllie time-average equation, or some other suitable transform, and the total porosity taken as the density-neutron crossplot porosity.",secondary porosity index

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Enhanced Oil Recovery,The second stage of hydrocarbon production during which an external fluid such as water or gas is injected into the reservoir through injection wells located in rock that has fluid communication with production wells. The purpose of secondary recovery is to maintain reservoir pressure and to displace hydrocarbons toward the wellbore. The most common secondary recovery techniques are gas injection and waterflooding. Normally, gas is injected into the gas cap and water is injected into the production zone to sweep oil from the reservoir. A pressure-maintenance program can begin during the primary recovery stage, but it is a form or enhanced recovery. The secondary recovery stage reaches its limit when the injected fluid (water or gas) is produced in considerable amounts from the production wells and the production is no longer economical. The successive use of primary recovery and secondary recovery in an oil reservoir produces about 15% to 40% of the original oil in place.",secondary recovery

Drilling Fluids,"A common anaerobic bacterium, commonly abbreviated SRB, that can convert sulfate ions, SO4-2, into S-2 and HS-, with the concomitant oxidation of a carbon source. The lignite, lignin, tannins, cellulose, starches and fatty acids found in many mud systems are carbon food sources for SRB. Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater. Bacteria accumulation can lead to pitting of steel, and the buildup of H2S increases the corrosiveness of the water, thus increasing the possibility of hydrogen blistering or sulfide stress cracking.",SRB

Geology,"One of the three main classes of rock (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary). Sedimentary rocks are formed at the Earth's surface through deposition of sediments derived from weathered rocks, biogenic activity or precipitation from solution. Clastic sedimentary rocks such as conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones and shales form as older rocks weather and erode, and their particles accumulate and lithify, or harden, as they are compacted and cemented. Biogenic sedimentary rocks form as a result of activity by organisms, including coral reefs that become limestone. Precipitates, such as the evaporite minerals halite (salt) and gypsum can form vast thicknesses of rock as seawater evaporates. Sedimentary rocks can include a wide variety of minerals, but quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite and evaporite group and clay group minerals are most common because of their greater stability at the Earth's surface than many minerals that comprise igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, can contain fossils because they form at temperatures and pressures that do not obliterate fossil remnants.",sedimentary

A source, such as a vibrator unit, dynamite shot, or an air gun, generates acoustic or elastic vibrations that travel into the Earth, pass through strata with different seismic responses and filtering effects, and return to the surface to be recorded as seismic data. Optimal acquisition varies according to local conditions and involves employing the appropriate source (both type and intensity), optimal configuration of receivers, and orientation of receiver lines with respect to geological features.

It is used as a stabilizing ingredient in oil- and synthetic-base mud, essential to formation of fatty-acid soap emulsifiers. It is an alkaline material that can be carried in excess to neutralize hydrogen sulfide [H2S] and carbon dioxide [CO2].",slaked lime
Drilling Fluids,"A piece of equipment required to conduct the electrical stability (ES) test, a test for oil-base and synthetic-base muds that indicates the emulsion and oil-wetting qualities of the sample. The test is performed by inserting the ES probe into a cup of 120°F [48.9°C] mud and pushing a test button. The ES meter automatically applies an increasing voltage (from 0 to 2000 volts) across an electrode gap in the probe. Maximum voltage that the mud will sustain across the gap before conducting current is displayed as the ES voltage. The modern ES meter has sine-wave circuitry, whereas older meters used square-wave circuits. (The older units should not be used because they do not correctly address the theory described in the reference below.) The ES sine-wave design and meaning of ES readings have been studied and were found to relate to an oil mud's oil-wetting of solids and to stability of the emulsion droplets in a complex fashion not yet understood.

Well Testing,"A state that a producing well reaches when the flow rate and well pressure are apparently constant for a reasonable period of time, such as a few hours or a day or more. The actual time period is rather arbitrary and depends on the location and the people involved. For shut-in wells, stabilization refers to a reasonably constant pressure. Stabilized pressures are commonly used as starting points for well tests. In reality, the time to stabilization at truly constant pressure and rate is infinite. The target stabilization for rigorous testing in gas wells is pseudosteady-state flow, and this may be recognized as the pressure change versus time predicted from formation properties and drainage area size. The onset of radial flow may produce an apparent stabilization that is acceptable for analysis when multirate flow periods are of equal duration.",stabilization
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Drilling Fluids,A chemical that preferentially adsorbs at an interface, lowering the surface tension or interfacial tension between fluids or between a fluid and a solid. This term encompasses a multitude of materials that function as emulsifiers, dispersants, oil-wetters, water-wetters, foamers and defoamers. The type of surfactant behavior depends on the structural groups on the molecule (or mixture of molecules).

Well Testing,"A gas well producing at a constant rate in which wellhead pressure changes no more than a small amount as a function of time. The actual amount of change permitted in a given time period to allow a well to be designated as stabilized may be fixed by law. Alternatively, the target stabilization for rigorous flow-after-flow testing in gas wells is pseudosteady-state flow, and this may be recognized as the pressure change versus time predicted from formation properties and drainage area size.",stabilized gas well
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"An enhanced oil recovery process in which alternating slugs of a surfactant solution and gas are injected into a reservoir. The injected surfactant and gas mix and generate foam that reduces the gas mobility, especially in previously swept or high-permeability regions of the reservoir. This improves sweep efficiency by mitigating gravity override and viscous fingering during gas injection. The presence of the surfactant in the injectant can also improve recovery by reducing interfacial tension between reservoir oil and the injection phases.",surfactant alternating gas
Geophysics,"The comparison, simulation or representation of seismic data to define the limits of seismic resolution, assess the ambiguity of interpretation or make predictions. Generation of a synthetic seismogram from a well log and comparing the synthetic, or modeled trace, with seismic data is a common direct modeling procedure. Generating a set of pseudologs from seismic data is the process known as seismic inversion, a type of indirect modeling. Models can be developed to address problems of structure and stratigraphy prior to acquisition of seismic data and during the interpretation of the data. As Sheriff (1991) points out, agreement between data and a model does not prove that the model is correct, since there can be numerous models that agree with a given data set.",seismic modeling

Drilling,"To drill with a mud motor rotating the bit downhole without rotating the drillstring from the surface. This operation is conducted when the bottomhole assembly has been fitted with a bent sub or a bent housing mud motor, or both, for directional drilling. Sliding is the predominant method to build and control or correct hole angle in modern directional drilling operations. Directional drilling is conceptually simple: Point the bit in the desired direction. This pointing is accomplished through the bent sub, which has a small angle offset from the axis of the drillstring, and a measurement device to determine the direction of offset. Without turning the drillstring, the bit is rotated with a mud motor, and drills in the direction it points. With steerable motors, when the desired wellbore direction is attained, the entire drillstring is rotated and drills straight rather than at an angle. By controlling the amount of hole drilled in the sliding versus the rotating mode, the wellbore trajectory can be controlled precisely.",slide

Production Facilities,"An operation in which the well stream is passed through two or more separators that are arranged in series. The first separator is called first-stage separator, the second separator is called second-stage separator and additional separators are named according to their position in the series. The operating pressures are sequentially reduced, so the highest pressure is found at the first separator and the lowest pressure at the final separator. The objective of stage separation is to maximize the hydrocarbon liquid recovery and to provide maximum stabilization to the resultant phases (liquid and gas) leaving the final separator. Stabilization means that considerable amounts of gas or liquid will not evolve from the final liquid and gas phases, respectively, in places such as stock tanks or gas pipelines. Additionally, stage separation reduces the horsepower required by a compressor, since the gas is fed at higher pressures.",stage separation

Drilling,"A completed measurement of the inclination and azimuth of a location in a well (typically the total depth at the time of measurement). In both directional and straight holes, the position of the well must be known with reasonable accuracy to ensure the correct wellbore path and to know its position in the event a relief well must be drilled. The measurements themselves include inclination from vertical, and the azimuth (or compass heading) of the wellbore if the direction of the path is critical. These measurements are made at discrete points in the well, and the approximate path of the wellbore computed from the discrete points. Measurement devices range from simple pendulum-like devices to complex electronic accelerometers and gyroscopes used more often as MWD becomes more popular. In simple pendulum measurements, the position of a freely hanging pendulum relative to a measurement grid (attached to the housing of the tool and assumed to represent the path of the wellbore) is captured on photographic film. The film is developed and examined when the tool is removed from the wellbore, either on wireline or the next time pipe is tripped out of the hole.",survey

Drilling,"An inexact term describing a borehole (and associated casing program) significantly smaller than a standard approach, commonly a wellbore less than 6 in. in diameter. The slimhole concept has its roots in the observed correlation between well costs and volume of rock extracted. If one can extract less rock, then well costs should fall. One form of slimhole work involves using more or less conventional equipment and procedures, but simply reducing the hole and casing sizes for each hole interval. A second form involves technology used for exploration boreholes in the hard rock mining industry. In the mining rig operations, the drillstem serves a dual purpose. After the hole is drilled, the drillstem remains in the hole and is cemented in place. Then a new drillstem is used for the new hole section, and also cemented in place.

Geophysics,"Another term for sequence stratigraphy, a field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied. The field originated during the 1960s with the study of the stratigraphy of the continental USA, where numerous unconformities could be correlated widely, and led to the proposal that major unconformities might mark synchronous global-scale events. Through sequence stratigraphy, widely-separated sediments that occur between correlatable unconformities could be compared with each other. Studies of outcrops and seismic lines bore out these concepts, which initially were called Seismic Stratigraphy and first published widely in 1977. Further study of seismic lines led to the interpretation of the geometry or architecture of seismic events as representing particular styles of sedimentation and depositional environments, and the integration of such interpretations with well log and core data. Because of the simultaneous, competitive nature of the research, numerous oil companies and academic groups use the terminology of sequence stratigraphy differently, and new terms are added continually.",seismic stratigraphy

Drilling,"To reduce pressure in a wellbore by moving pipe, wireline tools or rubber-cupped seals up the wellbore. If the pressure is reduced sufficiently, reservoir fluids may flow into the wellbore and towards the surface.

Geophysics,"The rate at which a seismic wave travels through a medium, that is, distance divided by traveltime. Seismic velocity can be determined from vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. It can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant-velocity (homogeneous) medium.",seismic velocity

Solvent injection is performed at several test pressures. Effluent production, density and composition are measured as functions of the injected volume. Oil recovery after injection of a specific number of pore volumes (PV) such as 1.2 PV of solvent is the test criterion for miscibility. Two trend lines appear on a plot of recovery versus pore pressure for several slim-tube tests. The point of intersection of those trend lines is the estimated MMP for the given oil-solvent system.

Drilling Fluids,"A drilling-mud additive used to control fluid loss in water muds ranging from freshwater to saturated-salt to high-pH lime muds. Starches have thermal stability to about 250°F [121°C]. They are subject to bacterial attack unless protected by high salinity or bactericide. Drilling-grade natural starch has API/ISO specifications for quality. Starches are carbohydrates of a general formula (C6H10O5)n and are derived from corn, wheat, oats, rice, potatoes, yucca and similar plants and vegetables. They consist of about 27% linear polymer (amylose) and about 73% branched polymer (amylopectin). The two polymers are intertwined within starch granules. Granules are insoluble in cold water, but soaking in hot water or under steam pressure ruptures their covering and the polymers hydrate into a colloidal suspension. This product is a pregelatinized starch and has been used in muds for many years. Amylose and amylopectin are nonionic polymers that do not interact with electrolytes. Derivatized starches, such as hydroxypropyl and carboxymethyl starches, are used in drill-in fluids, completion fluids and various brine systems as well as in drilling-mud systems.

Commonly, the sample is retested after it has been stirred. Static-aged mud, before it is stirred, simulates a mud that is static in a well while pipe is out of the hole during a bit trip or logging run.

The invention of the modern seismograph in 1880 promoted further studies of earthquakes.",seismology
Drilling,"A device used to grip the drillstring in a relatively nondamaging manner and suspend it in the rotary table. This device consists of three or more steel wedges that are hinged together, forming a near circle around the drillpipe. On the drillpipe side (inside surface), the slips are fitted with replaceable, hardened tool steel teeth that embed slightly into the side of the pipe. The outsides of the slips are tapered to match the taper of the rotary table. After the rig crew places the slips around the drillpipe and in the rotary, the driller slowly lowers the drillstring. As the teeth on the inside of the slips grip the pipe, the slips are pulled down. This downward force pulls the outer wedges down, providing a compressive force inward on the drillpipe and effectively locking everything together. Then the rig crew can unscrew the upper portion of the drillstring (kelly, saver sub, a joint or stand of pipe) while the lower part is suspended. After some other component is screwed onto the lower part of the drillstring, the driller raises the drillstring to unlock the gripping action of the slips, and the rig crew removes the slips from the rotary.",slips

Drilling Fluids,"A fine-grained, impermeable, sedimentary rock composed of clays and other minerals, usually with a high percentage of quartz. Shale is the most common, and certainly the most troublesome, rock type that must be drilled in order to reach oil and gas deposits. The characteristic that makes shales most troublesome to drillers is its water sensitivity, due in part to its clay content and the ionic composition of the clay. For this reason, oil-base drilling fluids are the mud of choice to drill the most water-sensitive shales.",sloughing shale

Perforating,The technique of selectively firing successive perforating guns arranged in a multiple gun assembly. This method is used when several intervals are to be perforated in one run and when the gun assembly must be relocated before the guns are fired. The resulting perforation pattern is known as selective perforating.,selective firing
Formation Evaluation,"A formation in which the velocity of the compressional wave traveling through the borehole fluid is greater than the velocity of the shear wave through the surrounding formation. In such conditions, there is no critical refraction of the shear wave and no shear head wave generated, so that standard techniques based on monopole transducers cannot be used to measure formation shear velocity. Instead, it is necessary to use dipole sources to excite the flexural mode. The velocity of the latter is closely related to that of the shear wave. In very slow formations, such as in high-porosity gas sands, the formation compressional velocity also may be less than the borehole fluid velocity, causing no compressional head wave. In such cases, it is possible to estimate the formation compressional velocity from the low-frequency end of a leaky mode.",slow formation

Formation Evaluation,"A parameter used to characterize neutron interactions in bulk material above the thermal region. The slowing-down length (Ls) is proportional to the root-mean-square distance from the point of emission of a high-energy neutron to the point at which its energy has decreased to the lower edge of the epithermal energy region. The slowing-down length is the physical parameter that best describes the response of an epithermal neutron porosity measurement, and describes a large part of the response of a thermal neutron porosity measurement. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than about 0.4 eV, while epithermal neutrons have higher energy, between about 0.4 and 10 eV.",slowing down length

Formation Evaluation,"With reference to pulsed neutron logging, the characteristic time for the decay of the epithermal neutron population. The slowing-down time of a formation is strongly dependent on the porosity. In openhole pulsed neutron logging, it is also dependent on the standoff between tool and borehole wall. Epithermal neutrons have energies above that of the surrounding matter, between about 0.4 eV and 10 eV.",slowing down time
Formation Evaluation,"The ideal spontaneous potential (SP) that would be observed opposite a permeable bed if the SP currents were prevented from flowing and any shaliness in the bed were ignored. The static spontaneous potential (SSP) is equal to the electrochemical potential. When current is flowing, the SP measures only that fraction of the potential drop that occurs in the borehole. In normal conditions, this potential drop is much higher than the drop in the formation because the cross-sectional area of the borehole is much smaller, and hence its resistance much higher. It is for this reason that in the middle of a thick, clean bed whose resistivity is not too high, the SP reads close to the SSP. However, in other conditions the SP is significantly less than the SSP. As well as ignoring shaliness in the sand, the SSP ignores other sources of potential and assumes a surrounding shale that is a perfect cationic membrane.",static spontaneous potential
Shale Gas,"Colloquial expression for a target location or area within a play or a reservoir that represents the best production or potential production. Geoscientists and engineers attempt to map sweet spots enable wellbores to be placed in the most productive areas of the reservoir.

Formation Evaluation," Geophysics,Also called interval transit time, The amount of time for a wave to travel a certain distance, proportional to the reciprocal of velocity, typically measured in microseconds per foot by an acoustic log and symbolized by t or DT. P-wave interval transit times for common sedimentary rock types range from 43 (dolostone) to 160 (unconsolidated shales) microseconds per foot, and can be distinguished from measurements of steel casing, which has a consistent transit time of 57 microseconds per foot.",slowness
Production Facilities,"A process used to remove hydrogen sulfide [H2S] and carbon dioxide [CO2] from a gas stream. These components are removed because they can form acidic solutions when they contact water, which will cause corrosion problems in gas pipelines. In a sweetening process, different types of ethanolamine can be used, including monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), diglycolamine (DGA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). Hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide are absorbed by the ethanolamine and sweet gas leaves at the top of the absorber. The ethanolamine is heated and acid gas (hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide gases) and water vapor are obtained. The water is removed while the acid gas can be flared or further treated in a sulfur recovery unit to separate out elemental sulfur. Finally, the lean ethanolamine is returned to the absorber.",sweetening
Drilling,"A particular type of floating vessel that is supported primarily on large pontoon-like structures submerged below the sea surface. The operating decks are elevated perhaps 100 or more feet above the pontoons on large steel columns. This design has the advantage of submerging most of the area of components in contact with the sea and minimizing loading from waves and wind. Semisubmersibles can operate in a wide range of water depths, including deep water. They are usually anchored with six to twelve anchors tethered by strong chains and wire cables, which are computer controlled to maintain stationkeeping. Semisubmersibles (called semisubs or simply semis) can be used for drilling, workover operations, and production platforms, depending on the equipment with which they are equipped. When fitted with a drilling package, they may be called semisubmersible drilling rigs.",semisubmersible
Formation Evaluation,"A technique used for identifying and measuring the slowness and time of arrival of coherent acoustic energy propagating across an array of receivers. The different packets of coherent energy can then be identified in terms of their origin, for example compressional, shear, Stoneley or other arrivals. In formation evaluation slowness-time coherence is used in conjunction with an array-sonic tool in which the full waveforms at each receiver have been recorded. The technique consists in passing a narrow window across the waveforms and measuring the coherence within the window for a wide range of slownesses and times of arrival.",slowness time coherence
Geophysics,"Another term for static correction, a bulk shift of a seismic trace in time during seismic processing. A common static correction is the weathering correction, which compensates for a layer of low seismic velocity material near the surface of the Earth. Other corrections compensate for differences in topography and differences in the elevations of sources and receivers.",statics
Drilling," Well Completions,An isolation device that relies on elastomers to expand and form an annular seal when immersed in certain wellbore fluids. The elastomers used in these packers are either oil- or water-sensitive. Their expansion rates and pressure ratings are affected by a variety of factors. Oil-activated elastomers, which work on the principle of absorption and dissolution, are affected by fluid temperature as well as the concentration and specific gravity of hydrocarbons in a fluid. Water-activated elastomers are typically affected by water temperature and salinity. This type of elastomer works on the principle of osmosis, which allows movement of water particles across a semi-permeable membrane based on salinity differences in the water on either side of the membrane.",swellable packer
Geophysics,The smallest change in a measurement that can be recorded by an instrument.,sensitivity
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"In matrix stimulation, a characteristic of rock that indicates the degree of reaction between the rock minerals and a given treating fluid. A formation is described as sensitive if a given stimulating fluid damages the formation. The detrimental reactions include disaggregation and collapse of the matrix, release of fines or formation of precipitates. Sensitivity depends on the overall reactivity of the formation minerals with the fluid; reactivity depends on the structure of the rock and the distribution of minerals within the rock. Sandstone sensitivity also depends on permeability; low-permeability formations are normally more sensitive than high-permeability sandstones for a given mineralogy because certain types of damage, such as formation of precipitates, are more harmful in small pore throats (as in low-permeability formations).",sensitivity
Reservoir Characterization,"A form of homogeneity in a single characteristic. Local stationarity occurs when two or more adjacent, locally homogeneous samples yield similar values of the property of interest.",stationarity
Production Facilities,"A cylindrical or spherical vessel used to separate oil, gas and water from the total fluid stream produced by a well. Separators can be either horizontal or vertical. Separators can be classified into two-phase and three-phase separators (commonly called free-water knockout). The two-phase type deals only with oil and gas, while the three-phase type handles oil, water and gas. Additionally, separators can be categorized according to their operating pressure. Low-pressure units handle pressures of 10 to 180 psi [69 to 1241 kPa]. Medium-pressure separators operate from 230 to 700 psi [1586 to 4826 kPa]. High-pressure units handle pressures of 975 to 1500 psi [6722 to 10,342 kPa]. Gravity segregation is the main force that accomplishes the separation, which means the heaviest fluid settles to the bottom and the lightest fluid rises to the top. Additionally, inside the vessel, the degree of separation between gas and liquid will depend on the separator operating pressure, the residence time of the fluid mixture and the type of flow of the fluid. Turbulent flow allows more bubbles to escape than laminar flow.",separator

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A thick, viscous emulsion containing oil, water, sediment and residue that forms because of the incompatibility of certain native crude oils and strong inorganic acids used in well treatments. Use of certain additives, such as surfactants, or the presence of dissolved iron can promote sludge formation, especially if asphaltenes are present in the crude oil. Therefore, it is important to test a sample of crude with the treating fluid before injecting a treatment into a reservoir.",sludge
Well Workover and Intervention,"The stationary slip set on a snubbing unit used when operating under light-pipe conditions. Under these conditions, the wellhead pressure is sufficient to eject the tubing string from the wellbore.

Drilling Fluids,"A volume of mud that is more dense than the mud in the drillpipe and wellbore annulus. A slug is used to displace mud out of the upper part of the drillpipe before pulling pipe out of the hole and is mixed in the pill pit by adding additional weighting material (barite) to a few barrels of mud from the surface pits. The pill is pumped into the top of the drillstring to push mud downward, out of the pipe, thus keeping the upper stands of pipe empty.",slug
Well Workover and Intervention,"A small volume of fluid, often of a higher density than the main body of fluid, within the circulating or production-fluid system that influences the flow or production characteristics of the well. A slug may be placed to ensure that fluids are naturally drained from a tubing string as it is pulled from the wellbore.

The resulting flow alternates between high-liquid and high-gas composition.",slug flow
Production Logging,"A multiphase-flow regime in pipes in which most of the lighter fluid is contained in large bubbles dispersed within, and pushing along, the heavier fluid. The word slug normally refers to the heavier, slower moving fluid, but sometimes to the bubbles of lighter fluid. There are also small bubbles within the liquid, but many of these have coalesced to form the large bubbles until they span much of the pipe. In gas-liquid mixtures, slug flow is similar to plug flow, but the bubbles are generally larger and move faster. As flow rates increase, slug flow becomes churn flow.",slug flow

Formation Evaluation,"A system that has reached equilibrium for the measurement or phenomenon concerned. In the case of permeability measurements on core samples, a steady state is reached when the flow rate, the upstream and the downstream pressures no longer change with time. At this point the permeability can be calculated from the flow rate and pressures and applying Darcy's equation. If gas is used, the inertial resistance and gas slippage (Klinkenberg effect) should be corrected for.",steady state
Geology,"Basin- or trough-shaped fold in rock in which rock layers are downwardly convex. The youngest rock layers form the core of the fold and outward from the core progressively older rocks occur.

Esters made from vegetable fatty acid and alcohol were among the first such fluids. Ethers and polyethers, made from alcohols and polyalcohols, have been used, along with paraffinic hydrocarbons and linear alkyl benzenes. Mixtures of these fluids are also used to make synthetic-base muds.",synthetic base fluid
Geology,"A field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied.The field originated during the 1960s with the study of the stratigraphy of the continental USA, where numerous unconformities could be correlated widely, and led to the proposal that major unconformities might mark synchronous global-scale events. Through sequence stratigraphy, widely-separated sediments that occur between correlatable unconformities could be compared with each other. Studies of outcrops and seismic lines bore out these concepts, which initially were called Seismic Stratigraphy and first published widely in 1977. Further study of seismic lines led to the interpretation of the geometry or architecture of seismic events as representing particular styles of sedimentation and depositional environments, and the integration of such interpretations with well log and core data. Because of the simultaneous, competitive nature of the research, numerous oil companies and academic groups use the terminology of sequence stratigraphy differently, and new terms are added continually.",sequence stratigraphy
Drilling Fluids,"Also called a slug, a volume of mud that is more dense than the mud in the drillpipe and wellbore annulus.

Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A two-phase mixture of liquid water and steam produced from a generator. The latent heat of vaporization for steam is very high, and when the steam condenses in the reservoir a significant amount of heat is transferred from the steam to the formation rock and fluids. Since steam is lighter and more mobile than oil, gravity differences and channeling of the steam through the most permeable parts of the reservoir can create sweep efficiency problems during steam-injection processes. To increase sweep efficiency, there are two categories of improvements. The first is operational changes such as selective completion of injector wells, fracturing operations and constructing horizontal wells, and the second is the use of additives in the steam. For example, water-soluble surfactants modify interfacial properties of the oil-water system, and foams reduce steam mobility.",steam
Geology,A type of minor fault whose sense of displacement is similar to its associated major fault. Antithetic-synthetic fault sets are typical in areas of normal faulting.,synthetic fault
Drilling Fluids,"A chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.",sequestering agent
Well Completions," Drilling Fluids, Well Workover and Intervention,Another term for chelating agent, a chemical used to bind metal ions to form a ring structure. Chelating agents stabilize or prevent the precipitation of damaging compounds. In the oil field, chelating agents are used in stimulation treatments and for cleaning surface facilities. They are also used to treat or remove scale or weighting agents in reservoir drilling fluids. During acid or scale-removal treatments, various compounds may be dissolved in the treatment fluid. As the acid reacts and the pH increases, reaction products may precipitate as a gelatinous, insoluble mass. Should this occur within the formation matrix, it is almost impossible to remove and permanent permeability damage may occur. Chelating agents prevent precipitation by keeping ions in a soluble form until the treatment fluid can be flowed back from the formation during cleanup. Typical oilfield chelating agents include EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), HEDTA (hydroxyethylenediamine triacetic acid), NTA (nitriolotriacetic acid) and citric acid.",sequestering agent
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"Another term for chelating agent, a chemical added to an acid to stabilize iron. The injected acid dissolves iron from rust, millscale, iron scales or iron-containing minerals in the formation. Iron can exist as ferric iron [Fe+3] or ferrous iron [Fe+2]. If the iron is not controlled, it will precipitate insoluble products such as ferric hydroxide and, in sour environments, ferrous sulfide [FeS], which will damage the formation. Chelating agents associate with iron [Fe+3 or Fe+2] to form soluble complexes. Citric acid, acetic acid and EDTA are effective chelating agents and can be used at temperatures up to 400oF [204oC].",sequestering agent

Within the steam chamber, rock temperature rises to the point where steam vapor can be sustained at reservoir pressure conditions. The steam chamber is normally found in the upper portion of a reservoir sand between a steam injector and a producer, where steam has broken through to the producer. With time, the steam chamber can expand to cover an entire area of a five-spot pattern steamflood. For a steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) system, the steam chamber in a mature field project can extend from a broad area across the top of the sand to a narrow finger down to the producing horizontal well near the bottom of the sand.

Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery, Well Completions,A method of thermal recovery in which steam generated at surface is injected into the reservoir through specially distributed injection wells. When steam enters the reservoir, it heats up the crude oil and reduces its viscosity. The heat also distills light components of the crude oil, which condense in the oil bank ahead of the steam front, further reducing the oil viscosity. The hot water that condenses from the steam and the steam itself generate an artificial drive that sweeps oil toward producing wells. Another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the interfacial tension that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil. Steamflooding is also called continuous steam injection or steam drive.",steam flood
Geophysics,"The result of one of many forms of forward modeling to predict the seismic response of the Earth. A more narrow definition used by seismic interpreters is that a synthetic seismogram, commonly called a synthetic, is a direct one-dimensional model of acoustic energy traveling through the layers of the Earth. The synthetic seismogram is generated by convolving the reflectivity derived from digitized acoustic and density logs with the wavelet derived from seismic data. By comparing marker beds or other correlation points picked on well logs with major reflections on the seismic section, interpretations of the data can be improved. The quality of the match between a synthetic seismogram depends on well log quality, seismic data processing quality, and the ability to extract a representative wavelet from seismic data, among other factors. The acoustic log is generally calibrated with check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP) first-arrival information before combining with the density log to produce acoustic impedance.",synthetic seismogram

In the early days of rotary drilling, some rigs had no more solids control than a large settling pit into which mud was discharged after coming back from the wellbore and suction for the mud pumps was taken at the other end of the pit. A major drawback to this type of cleaning is that solids intentionally put into the mud, such as barite, may settle to the bottom and be discarded rather than circulated back into the wellbore.",settling pit

Formation Evaluation,"Water in microporosity or other small pores. The term usually refers to the nuclear magnetic resonance signal of such water, which occurs at very short times and overlaps the signal from clay-bound water.",small pore water
Enhanced Oil Recovery,A barrier or resistance to the flow of injected steam formed by a volume around a producing well in a steamflood that contains high oil and liquid water saturation. This is typically maintained by choking the production well to keep the surrounding formation just below saturated steam temperature and pressure conditions. It is used in the steam-assisted gravity-drainage process.,steam trap
Geophysics,"Generally, an area of the Earth from which waves do not emerge or cannot be recorded. In seismology, the term is used to more specifically describe regions of the subsurface where P-waves and S-waves are difficult to detect, such as regions of the core at certain distances from the epicenter of an earthquake, or the point on the Earth's surface directly above an earthquake. Such zones were first observed in 1914 by Beno Gutenberg (1889 to 1960), an American geologist born in Germany. Because of the molten nature of the outer core, S-waves are especially difficult to detect at 103 to 142 degrees from the epicenter of an earthquake and not observable from 142 to 180 degrees from the epicenter. Areas below salt features are also called shadow zones because the high velocity of salt bends and traps energy, so seismic data quality beneath salt is generally poor unless special seismic processing is performed.",shadow zone
Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A thermal production method for heavy oil that pairs a high-angle injection well with a nearby production well drilled along a parallel trajectory. The pair of high-angle wells is drilled with a vertical separation of about 5 m [16 ft]. Steam is injected into the reservoir through the upper well. As the steam rises and expands, it heats up the heavy oil, reducing its viscosity. Gravity forces the oil to drain into the lower well where it is produced.",steam assisted gravity drainage
Drilling,"Abbreviation for shale shaker, the primary and probably most important device on the rig for removing drilled solids from the mud. This vibrating sieve is simple in concept, but a bit more complicated to use efficiently. A wire-cloth screen vibrates while the drilling fluid flows on top of it. The liquid phase of the mud and solids smaller than the wire mesh pass through the screen, while larger solids are retained on the screen and eventually fall off the back of the device and are discarded. Obviously, smaller openings in the screen clean more solids from the whole mud, but there is a corresponding decrease in flow rate per unit area of wire cloth. Hence, the drilling crew should seek to run the screens (as the wire cloth is called), as fine as possible, without dumping whole mud off the back of the shaker. Where it was once common for drilling rigs to have only one or two shale shakers, modern high-efficiency rigs are often fitted with four or more shakers, thus giving more area of wire cloth to use, and giving the crew the flexibility to run increasingly fine screens.",shaker
Geology,"[(1/2Ca,Na)0.7(Al,Mg,Fe)4(Si,Al)8O20(OH)47nH2O)]A group of clay minerals that includes montmorillonite. This type of mineral tends to swell when exposed to water. Bentonite includes minerals of the smectite group.",smectite
Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery, Well Completions,A method of thermal recovery in which steam generated at surface is injected into the reservoir through specially distributed injection wells. When steam enters the reservoir, it heats up the crude oil and reduces its viscosity. The heat also distills light components of the crude oil, which condense in the oil bank ahead of the steam front, further reducing the oil viscosity. The hot water that condenses from the steam and the steam itself generate an artificial drive that sweeps oil toward producing wells. Another contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the interfacial tension that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil. Steamflooding is also called continuous steam injection or steam drive.",steamflood

Geology," Shale Gas,A fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps. Gas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.",shale
Drilling Fluids,"A fine-grained, impermeable, sedimentary rock composed of clays and other minerals, usually with a high percentage of quartz. Shale is the most common, and certainly the most troublesome, rock type that must be drilled in order to reach oil and gas deposits. The characteristic that makes shales most troublesome to drillers is its water sensitivity, due in part to its clay content and the ionic composition of the clay. For this reason, oil-base drilling fluids are the mud of choice to drill the most water-sensitive shales.",shale
Drilling Fluids,"A category of clay minerals that have a three-layer crystalline structure (one alumina and two silica layers) and that exhibit a common characteristic of hydrational swelling when exposed to with water.

It is also used as an oil-mud additive when made oil-dispersible by surface treatment. Smectite clays that occur naturally in shales cause wellbore and mud-control problems due to their hydrational swelling and colloidal dispersion characteristics.",smectite clay
Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,Parameter used to monitor the efficiency of oil production processes based on steam injection. Commonly abbreviated as SOR, it measures the volume of steam required to produce one unit volume of oil. Typical values of SOR for cyclic steam stimulation are in the range of three to eight, while typical SOR values for steam assisted gravity drainage are in the range of two to five. The lower the SOR, the more efficiently the steam is utilized and the lower the associated fuel costs.",steam oil ratio

Formation Evaluation,"The average reading of the spontaneous potential (SP) log opposite the shale layers in a well. Opposite shales, the SP is relatively constant and changes only slowly with depth. This is the shale baseline. The log is normally adjusted by the logging engineer to read near zero at the baseline.

Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the characteristic time for longitudinal relaxation. In rocks, longitudinal relaxation is the inverse sum of the surface relaxation and bulk relaxation. T1 is not normally measured in NMR logging, but is an important parameter in deciding the polarization time and hence the logging speed. T1 is closely related to the transverse relaxation time, T2. The ratio T1/T2 in water-filled rocks is typically between 1.5 and 2.5. In light hydrocarbons and gas, the ratio increases up to 10 and more as the viscosity decreases.",T1
Drilling,"Gas entrained in the drilling fluid during a pipe trip, which typically results in a significant increase in gas that is circulated to surface.

Formation Evaluation,"In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging, the characteristic time for transverse relaxation. In rocks, there are three components of the transverse relaxation: surface, Ts; bulk, Tb; and diffusion relaxation, Td. T2 is the inverse sum of each component for each fluid, as follows: 1/T2 = 1/Ts + 1/Tb + 1/Td. Because of the reciprocal sum, the smallest of the three types of relaxations is the most important in determining the final T2 for each fluid. There is not one single value of T2 for a rock but a wide distribution of values lying anywhere between fractions of a millisecond and several seconds. The distribution of T2 values is the principal output of an NMR log.",T2

Geophysics,"A technique to measure and display the three-dimensional distribution of velocity or reflectivity of a volume of the Earth by using numerous sources and receivers. There are several types of tomography used by geophysicists, including transmission tomography (which uses measurements between boreholes, surface-to-surface, or between a borehole and the surface), reflection or seismic tomography (based on standard reflection seismology), and diffraction tomography (using Fermat's principle for computations instead of Snell's law). Variations in velocity can be attributed to changes in density and elastic properties of rocks, which in turn are affected by the increasing temperature with depth in the Earth. Tomographic techniques have been used to construct maps of the Earth's interior, deep in the mantle, as well as for mapping the shallow subsurface by borehole tomography.",tomography

Formation Evaluation,"A measurement of the slowing down and capture of neutrons between a source and one or more thermal neutron detectors. The neutron source emits high-energy neutrons that are slowed mainly by elastic scattering to near thermal levels. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV. The slowing-down process is dominated by hydrogen. At thermal levels, the neutrons diffuse through the material until they undergo thermal capture. Capture is dominated by chlorine, hydrogen and other thermal neutron absorbers. Typical thermal neutron measurements use a chemical neutron source and two thermal neutron detectors. An accelerator source (neutron generator) is sometimes used. Some, mainly earlier, devices measure the gamma rays emitted by thermal capture, rather than thermal neutrons.",thermal neutron porosity measurement

Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A general term for injection processes that introduce heat into a reservoir. Thermal recovery is used to produce viscous, thick oils with API gravities less than 20. These oils cannot flow unless they are heated and their viscosity is reduced enough to allow flow toward producing wells. During thermal recovery, crude oil undergoes physical and chemical changes because of the effects of the heat supplied. Physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity and interfacial tension are altered. The chemical changes involve different reactions such as cracking, which is the destruction of carbon-carbon bonds to generate lower molecular weight compounds, and dehydrogenation, which is the rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Thermal recovery is a major branch of enhanced oil recovery processes and can be subdivided in two types: hot fluid injection such as steam injection (steamflood or cyclic steam injection) and hot waterflooding and in-situ combustion processes.",thermal recovery

Tool joints are usually made of steel that has been heat treated to a higher strength than the steel of the tube body. The large-diameter section of the tool joints provides a low stress area where pipe tongs are used to grip the pipe. Hence, relatively small cuts caused by the pipe tongs do not significantly impair the strength or life of the joint of drillpipe.",tool joint

Since the total length is more than can be conveniently handled in one piece, the logging tool is divided into different sections that are assembled at the wellsite. These sections consist of cartridges and sondes. Different measurements can be combined to make up a tool string. The total length of a tool string may range from 10 to 100 ft [3 to 30 m] or more.

Drilling,"A device that turns the drillstring. It consists of one or more motors (electric or hydraulic) connected with appropriate gearing to a short section of pipe called a quill, that in turn may be screwed into a saver sub or the drillstring itself. The topdrive is suspended from the hook, so the rotary mechanism is free to travel up and down the derrick. This is radically different from the more conventional rotary table and kelly method of turning the drillstring because it enables drilling to be done with three joint stands instead of single joints of pipe. It also enables the driller to quickly engage the pumps or the rotary while tripping pipe, which cannot be done easily with the kelly system.

Drilling,"The vertical distance from a point in the well (usually the current or final depth) to a point at the surface, usually the elevation of the rotary kelly bushing (RKB). This is one of two primary depth measurements used by the drillers, the other being measured depth. TVD is important in determining bottomhole pressures, which are caused in part by the hydrostatic head of fluid in the wellbore. For this calculation, measured depth is irrelevant and TVD must be used. For most other operations, the driller is interested in the length of the hole or how much pipe will fit into the hole. For those measurements, measured depth, not TVD, is used. While the drilling crew should be careful to designate which measurement they are referring to, if no designation is used, they are usually referring to measured depth.

Drilling,"A device that turns the drillstring. It consists of one or more motors (electric or hydraulic) connected with appropriate gearing to a short section of pipe called a quill, that in turn may be screwed into a saver sub or the drillstring itself. The topdrive is suspended from the hook, so the rotary mechanism is free to travel up and down the derrick. This is radically different from the more conventional rotary table and kelly method of turning the drillstring because it enables drilling to be done with three joint stands instead of single joints of pipe. It also enables the driller to quickly engage the pumps or the rotary while tripping pipe, which cannot be done easily with the kelly system. While not a panacea, modern topdrives are a major improvement to drilling rig technology and are a large contributor to the ability to drill more difficult extended-reach wellbores. In addition, the topdrive enables drillers to minimize both frequency and cost per incident of stuck pipe.",topdrive
Production Facilities,"Measurement of the dimensions of an oil tank, such as external diameter and height, using a steel tape. Once the measurements are recorded, they may be used to prepare tank tables, which describe tank capacity.",tank calibration
Drilling Fluids,"The characteristic of a fluid, such as a drilling mud, to form a gelled structure over time when not subject to shearing and then to liquefy when agitated. The viscosity of a thixotropic fluid changes with time under constant shear rate until reaching equilibrium. Most drilling muds exhibit thixotropy, which is necessary for fast drilling, efficient cuttings lifting and to support weighting material when mud flow stops. Gel strength measured at various time intervals indicates the relative thixotropy of a mud. Thixotropy is sometimes desirable to provide resistance to flowing, such as to avoid or reduce losses or flow into a weak formation.",thixotropy

Formation Evaluation,"An element with an atomic number of 90. The 232Th isotope is radioactive and decays with a half-life of 1.4 * 1010 years through a series of intermediate isotopes to a stable isotope of lead. The intermediate isotopes emit a wide range of gamma rays, the most prominent being that of thallium, 208Tl. It is assumed that formations are in secular equilibrium; that is, the relative proportions of parent and daughter isotopes remain constant, and the measured spectrum is directly related to the amount of 232Th. The concentration in the Earth's crust is about 12 parts per million, ppm, by weight. Thorium-bearing minerals are rare. Thorium is a trace element associated with clays and heavy minerals. It is very immobile so that quantity measured today probably was present at the time of deposition. A log of thorium is presented in parts per million. It is often a good measure of clay content.",thorium
Formation Evaluation,"A plot representing the effect of invasion on resistivity measurements that have different depths of investigation. The plot assumes a step-profile model of invasion and determines true resistivity, flushed zone resistivity and diameter of invasion from ratios of deep-, medium- and shallow-resistivity measurements. Strictly speaking, when both resistive invasion and conductive invasion are plotted, the chart is called a butterfly chart. When only one is plotted, it is known as a tornado chart.",tornado chart

Geophysics,A Stoneley wave that occurs at the low frequencies of seismic data.,tube wave
Geophysics,"An interface wave that occurs in cased wellbores when a Rayleigh wave encounters a wellbore and perturbs the fluid in the wellbore. The tube wave travels down the wellbore along the interface between the fluid in the wellbore and the wall of the wellbore. A tube wave suffers little energy loss and typically retains a very high amplitude which interferes with reflected arrivals occurring later in time on vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. Because the tube wave is coupled to the formation through which it is traveling, it can perturb the formation across open fractures intersecting the borehole. This squeezing effect can generate secondary tube waves which travel both up and down from the fracture location. Such events can be diagnostic of the presence of open fractures and their amplitude related qualitatively to the length and width, e.g., volume of the fluid-filled fracture space. This effect is generally seen only in shallow formations where the overburden pressure is lower.",tube wave

Drilling,"A cheap, expendable, perhaps even disposable threaded shape to mate with threads on drillstring and casing components. Thread protectors prevent harmful impacts and other contact to the metal thread surfaces. Some protectors are strong enough and are fitted with lifting eyes so that they may be screwed into a joint of drillpipe, a drill collar or another component and a chain tied to the eye for lifting the joint. Except for this type, most of the other available styles of thread protectors are relatively inexpensive, being made from thermoplastics and various epoxy resins.",thread protector

Formation Evaluation,"A measure of the geometric complexity of a porous medium. Tortuosity is a ratio that characterizes the convoluted pathways of fluid diffusion and electrical conduction through porous media. In the fluid mechanics of porous media, tortuosity is the ratio of the length of a streamline—a flow line or path—between two points to the straight-line distance between those points. Tortuosity is thus related to the ratio of a fluid's diffusion coefficient when it is not confined by a porous medium to its effective diffusion coefficient when confined in a porous medium. Tortuosity is also related to the formation factor, which is the ratio of electrical resistivity of a conductive fluid in a porous medium to the electrical resistivity of the fluid itself. In some literature, tortuosity denotes the square of the ratio defined above, whereas in other literature, the term tortuosity factor is used for the square of the ratio.",tortuosity
Geology," Drilling, Reservoir Characterization,A measure of deviation from a straight line. It is the ratio of the actual distance traveled between two points, including any curves encountered, divided by the straight line distance. Tortuosity is used by drillers to describe wellbore trajectory, by log analysts to describe electrical current flow through rock and by geologists to describe pore systems in rock and the meander of rivers.",tortuosity
Perforating,"The use of tubing, drillpipe or coiled tubing to convey perforating guns to the required depth. Initially, the technique was developed as a means for conveying the gun string on the production tubing, with the guns remaining in the well until they are removed during the first workover. The subsequent popularity of highly deviated and horizontal wells increased the requirement for tubing-conveyed perforating as the only means of gaining access to the perforating depth. The term is often abbreviated as TCP.",tubing conveyed perforating

Geophysics,"A type of multicomponent seismic data acquired in a land, marine, or borehole environment by using three orthogonally oriented geophones or accelerometers. 3C is particularly appropriate when the addition of a hydrophone (the basis for 4C seismic data) adds no value to the measurement, as for example, on land. This technique allows determination of both the type of wave and its direction of propagation.",three component seismic data

Geophysics,"A set of numerous closely-spaced seismic lines that provide a high spatially sampled measure of subsurface reflectivity. Typical receiver line spacing can range from 300 m [1000 ft] to over 600 m [2000 ft], and typical distances between shotpoints and receiver groups is 25 m [82 ft] (offshore and internationally) and 110 ft or 220 ft [34 to 67 m] (onshore USA, using values that are even factors of the 5280 feet in a mile). Bin sizes are commonly 25 m, 110 ft or 220 ft. The resultant data set can be cut in any direction but still display a well sampled seismic section. The original seismic lines are called in-lines. Lines displayed perpendicular to in-lines are called crosslines. In a properly migrated 3D seismic data set, events are placed in their proper vertical and horizontal positions, providing more accurate subsurface maps than can be constructed on the basis of more widely spaced 2D seismic lines, between which significant interpolation might be necessary. In particular, 3D seismic data provide detailed information about fault distribution and subsurface structures. Computer-based interpretation and display of 3D seismic data allow for more thorough analysis than 2D seismic data.",three dimensional seismic data
Shale Gas,"The concentration of organic material in source rocks as represented by the weight percent of organic carbon. A value of approximately 0.5% total organic carbon by weight percent is considered the minimum for an effective source rock, although values of 2% are considered the minimum for shale gas reservoirs; values exceeding 10% exist, although some geoscientists assert that high total organic carbon values indicate the possibility of kerogen filling pore space rather than other forms of hydrocarbons. Total organic carbon is measured from 1-g samples of pulverized rock that are combusted and converted to CO or CO2. If a sample appears to contain sufficient total organic carbon to generate hydrocarbons, it may be subjected to pyrolysis.",total organic carbon
Well Completions,A system of classifying the material specifications for steel alloys used in the manufacture of tubing.,tubing grade
Formation Evaluation,"In a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the use of a gradual rather than a sharp cutoff to distinguish between bound water and free water. A sharp cutoff at, for example T2 = 33 ms in sandstones, is normally used to distinguish free water (all T2s above 33 ms) from bound water (all T2s below 33ms). In a water-filled rock, in the fast diffusion limit, T2 is directly related to pore size. The distinction between bound and free water is based on the assumption that all free water resides in large pores, and all bound water in small pores. However, in rocks with large pores, a significant volume of bound water exists on the surface of the grains around a large pore. Being part of a large pore, it gives a long T2 and will be incorrectly counted as free water. One solution is the tapered cutoff, in which the bound water is the sum of all the T2 below a minimum, for example 5 ms, and is then a progressively smaller fraction of the volume at T2s up to a maximum, for example 500 ms. All signal above 500 ms represents free water. The form of the taper is usually empirical, but is based on some model of pore shape, such as a bundle of tubes. See Kleinberg RL and Boyd A: 'Tapered Cutoffs for Magnetic Resonance Bound Water Volume' paper SPE 38737, presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, San Antonio, Texas, USA, October 5-8, 1997.",tapered cutoff

Drilling,"A string of drillpipe or casing that consists of two or more sizes or weights. In most tapered strings, a larger diameter pipe or casing is placed at the top of the wellbore and the smaller size at the bottom. Note that since the pipe is put into the well bottom first, the smaller pipe is run into the hole first, followed by the larger diameter. Other than the different sizes, which are usually chosen to optimize well economics, there is nothing distinctive about the pipe sections. However, pipe-handling tools must be available for each pipe size, not just one size, as is the typical case.",tapered string
Well Completions,"A string comprising tubing or components of varying size or dimension. A tapered production string may be configured with larger OD tubing joints in the upper wellbore area to optimize the hydraulic performance of the string.

Well Workover and Intervention,"A tubing string or work string that is made up from tubulars of different outside diameters (OD). In production applications, this may be used to improve the flow and production characteristics of a well.

Retort solids thus include suspended solids, dissolved solids (salts), charred organic materials and volatile materials that do not condense. For calculations, retort solids are normally assumed to be only suspended and dissolved solids, as in the equation below. Volume percent suspended solids (weighting material plus drill solids) is of particular interest to mud engineers. To calculate that percentage, the volume increase caused by the dissolved salts is determined from filtrate analyses of chloride and calcium ions. For oil muds, the calculations are more complicated.",total solids

Production Facilities,"A vessel that separates the well fluids into gas and two types of liquids: oil and water. A three-phase separator can be horizontal, vertical or spherical. This type of separator is commonly called a free-water knockout because its main use is to remove any free water that can cause problems such as corrosion and formation of hydrates or tight emulsions, which are difficult to break. A free-water knockout is commonly called a three-phase separator because it can separate gas, oil and free water. The liquids that are discharged from the free-water knockout are further treated in vessels called treaters. Free-water knockout is abbreviated as FWKO.",three phase separator
Drilling,"A work shift of a drilling crew. Drilling operations usually occur around the clock because of the cost to rent a rig. As a result, there are usually two separate crews working twelve-hour tours to keep the operation going.

Heavy Oil,"A sand body that contains heavy hydrocarbon residues such as tar or asphalt, or degraded oil that has lost its volatile components. Hydrocarbons can be liberated from tar sands by heating and other processes, but tar sands, such as the Athabasca tar sands of Canada, are not commonly commercial because of high costs of production.

Production Logging,"Another term for velocity-shot measurement, a method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used. Velocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 B/D [16m3/d]. They are not usually run in production wells because of problems of tracer disposal. In multiphase flow, the tracer most often travels with the continuous phase, thereby giving a type of phase-velocity log.",tracer ejector measurement

Perforating,"Abbreviation for tubing-conveyed perforating, the use of tubing, drillpipe or coiled tubing to convey perforating guns to the required depth. Initially, the technique was developed as a means for conveying the gun string on the production tubing, with the guns remaining in the well until they are removed during the first workover. The subsequent popularity of highly deviated and horizontal wells increased the requirement for tubing-conveyed perforating as the only means of gaining access to the perforating depth.",TCP
Production Logging,"A method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type ofradioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells. In very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.",tracer loss measurement
Perforating," Well Completions,A special perforating gun, or charge, that is designed for limited penetration to allow an inner tubing or casing string to be perforated without damaging a surrounding outer string.

Drilling,"Abbreviation for total depth. The depth of the bottom of the well. Usually, it is the depth where drilling has stopped.",TD
Production Logging,"A technique in which a tracer is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. Radioactive tracers have been used from the 1940s and are still common for determining flow profiles in injection wells. Tracers with high neutron-capture cross section, such as borax or high-salinity water, were introduced in the 1970s to record injection/pulsed neutron logs. In multiphase production wells, special tracers were introduced in the 1990s to move with only one phase, so as to give a phase-velocity log. Radioactive tracers with different energies are used to track the development of fractures, or other processes, in the multiple-isotope log. Tracer measurements are used qualitatively to determine the movement of fluids behind pipe, or quantitatively to determine fluid-flow velocity within the pipe.",tracer measurement

Geology,"Also known as plate tectonics, the unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.",tectonics

Formation Evaluation,"A system for converting the measurements recorded by a wireline or measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tool into a suitable form for transmission to the surface. In the case of wireline logging, the measurements are converted into electronic pulses or analog signals that are sent up the cable. In the case of MWD, they are usually converted into an amplitude or frequency-modulated pattern of mud pulses. Some MWD tools use wirelines run inside the drillpipe. Others use wireless telemetry, in which signals are sent as electromagnetic waves through the Earth. Wireless telemetry is also used downhole to send signals from one part of an MWD tool to another.",telemetry

Geophysics,"A phenomenon of constructive or destructive interference of waves from closely spaced events or reflections. At a spacing of less than one-quarter of the wavelength, reflections undergo constructive interference and produce a single event of high amplitude. At spacing greater than that, the event begins to be resolvable as two separate events. The tuning thickness is the bed thickness at which two events become indistinguishable in time, and knowing this thickness is important to seismic interpreters who wish to study thin reservoirs. The tuning thickness can be expressed by the following formula:Z = VI/2.8 fmax,where Z = tuning thickness of a bed, equal to 1/4 of the wavelengthVI = interval velocity of the targetfmax = maximum frequency in the seismic section.The equation assumes that the interfering wavelets are identical in frequency content and are zero-phase and is useful when planning a survey to determine the maximum frequency needed to resolve a given thickness. Spatial and temporal sampling requirements can then be established for the survey.",tuning effect
Geophysics,"An electromagnetic method in which naturally occurring, low-frequency electric currents (telluric currents), are measured at a base station and compared with values measured at other stations.

Geology,"Sedimentary deposits formed by turbidity currents in deep water at the base of the continental slope and on the abyssal plain. Turbidites commonly show predictable changes in bedding from coarse layers at the bottom to finer laminations at the top, known as Bouma sequences, that result from different settling velocities of the particle sizes present. The high energy associated with turbidite deposition can result in destruction of earlier deposited layers by subsequent turbidity currents.",turbidite
Well Completions,"A section of liner that is run from a liner hanger back to the wellhead after the initial liner and hanger system have been installed and cemented.

Geology,"An influx of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water down a slope into a larger body of water; also called a density current because the suspended sediment results in the current having a higher density than the clearer water into which it flows. Such currents can occur in lakes and oceans, in some cases as by-products of earthquakes or mass movements such as slumps. The sedimentary deposits that form as the current loses energy are called turbidites and can be preserved as Bouma sequences.

Well Completions,"A fluid-flow regime characterized by swirling or chaotic motion as the fluid moves along the pipe or conduit. The linear velocity of the fluid particles is similar regardless of position in the conduit, although particles close to the conduit walls have a lower velocity. This characteristic makes turbulent flow an efficient flow regime for the pickup and transport of solids. However, the potential for erosion may be significant, especially with abrasive fluids and a tortuous flow path.",turbulent flow
Production Logging,"A type of flow for single-phase fluids in which the velocity at any point may vary in both direction and magnitude with time. Turbulent flow is characterized by random, irregular, locally circular currents, or vortices. It occurs in straight pipes when the Reynolds number is above a critical value, corresponding to a higher production rate. Below this value, the flow is laminar. For turbulent flow in straight pipes, the velocity increases from zero at the wall of the pipe, passes through a thin layer of laminar flow to reach a near constant value over most of the pipe.",turbulent flow

Although the geothermal gradient varies from place to place, it averages 25 to 30 °C/km [15 °F/1000 ft]. Temperature gradients sometimes increase dramatically around volcanic areas. It is particularly important for drilling fluids engineers to know the geothermal gradient in an area when they are designing a deep well.

Drilling,"A type of financing arrangement for the drilling of a wellbore that places considerable risk and potential reward on the drilling contractor. Under such an arrangement, the drilling contractor assumes full responsibility for the well to some predetermined milestone such as the successful running of logs at the end of the well, the successful cementing of casing in the well or even the completion of the well. Until this milestone is reached, the operator owes nothing to the contractor. The contractor bears all risk of trouble in the well, and in extreme cases, may have to abandon the well entirely and start over. In return for assuming such risk, the price of the well is usually a little higher than the well would cost if relatively trouble free. Therefore, if the contractor succeeds in drilling a trouble-free well, the fee added as contingency becomes profit. Some operators, however, have been required by regulatory agencies to remedy problem wells, such as blowouts, if the turnkey contractor does not.",turnkey
Production Logging,"A record of the temperature gradient in a well. The temperature log is interpreted by looking for anomalies, or departures, from the reference gradient. This reference might be the geothermal gradient, a log recorded before production started or a log recorded with the well shut-in. Most anomalies are related to the entry of fluids into the borehole or fluid exit into the formation. Since the temperature is affected by material outside the casing, a temperature log is sensitive to not only the borehole but also the formation and the casing-formation annulus. Temperature logs have many applications, with the most common being to identify zones producing or taking fluid, to evaluate a cement or hydraulic fracture treatment, and to locate lost circulation zones and casing leaks. Since temperature takes time to dissipate, a temperature log tends to reflect the behavior of a well over a longer time period than other measurements.",temperature log
Geophysics,"The duration of time for a P-wave to travel one foot, typically displayed on an acoustic log.

Drilling,"The vertical distance from a point in the well (usually the current or final depth) to a point at the surface, usually the elevation of the rotary kelly bushing (RKB). This is one of two primary depth measurements used by the drillers, the other being measured depth. TVD is important in determining bottomhole pressures, which are caused in part by the hydrostatic head of fluid in the wellbore. For this calculation, measured depth is irrelevant and TVD must be used. For most other operations, the driller is interested in the length of the hole or how much pipe will fit into the hole. For those measurements, measured depth, not TVD, is used. While the drilling crew should be careful to designate which measurement they are referring to, if no designation is used, they are usually referring to measured depth. Note that measured depth, due to intentional or unintentional curves in the wellbore, is always longer than true vertical depth.",TVD

Most of the remaining oil or water flows up along the pipe walls. The flow is relatively chaotic, producing a frothy mixture. Unlike slug flow, neither phase is continuous. The gas slugs are relatively unstable, and take on large, elongated shapes. Also known as churn flow, this flow is an intermediate flow condition between slug flow and mist flow, and occurs at relatively high gas velocity. As the gas velocity increases, it changes into annular flow.",transition flow

Formation Evaluation,"With reference to invasion, the volume between the flushed zone and the undisturbed zone in which the mud filtrate has only partially displaced the moveable formation fluids. One common model of invasion assumes a smooth transition in resistivity and other formation properties from the flushed to the undisturbed zone.

Production Logging,"A technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using two logging runs over the zone of interest, one up and one down. If the two passes are run at the same cable speed, they will overlay below the perforations, where there is no flow. If they were not run at the same speed, the curves are shifted to overlay. Elsewhere, the separation between the curves gives the relative contribution of each zone. Viscosity changes should have a small effect, since they will have the same influence on both passes.

Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,Abbreviation for thermal enhanced oil recovery, also known as thermal recovery, a general term for injection processes that introduce heat into a reservoir. Thermal recovery is used to produce viscous, thick oils with API gravities less than 20. These oils cannot flow unless they are heated and their viscosity is reduced enough to allow flow toward producing wells. During thermal recovery, crude oil undergoes physical and chemical changes because of the effects of the heat supplied. Physical properties such as viscosity, specific gravity and interfacial tension are altered. The chemical changes involve different reactions such as cracking, which is the destruction of carbon-carbon bonds to generate lower molecular weight compounds, and dehydrogenation, which is the rupture of carbon-hydrogen bonds.

Well Testing,"A method for quantifying well and reservoir parameters such as permeability, skin, fracture half-length, dual-porosity parameters, and others, by comparing the pressure change and its derivative of the acquired data to reservoir model curve families, called type curves. When a match is found between data and a type curve, the parameters that characterize the behavior of the model providing a match are thereby determined. Originally, type-curve analysis was done manually using only the pressure change. With the introduction of the pressure derivative, the analysis requires matching both pressure change and its derivative. Computer-assisted matching permits rigorous accounting for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during (in the case of drawdown analysis) the transient data acquisition, as well as providing a continuum of solutions instead of a type-curve family derived from discrete values for the governing parameters.",type curve analysis

Well Testing,"Families of the paired pressure change and its derivative computed from a model. The model is usually generated from an analytical solution of the diffusion equation with boundary conditions strategically defined to enable observation of theoretical trends in the pressure-transient response. The boundary conditions that can be defined near the well include constant or variable wellbore storage, limited entry (partial penetration), radial composite (damage skin due to permeability alteration), and a fracture extending the cylindrical wellbore to a extended plane. The borehole trajectory can be vertical, angled, or horizontal. The distant boundary conditions include a sealing or partially sealing planar boundary (fault), intersecting faults and rectangular boundaries (sealing or constant pressure). Further, the diffusion equation can be adjusted to accommodate reservoir heterogeneity in the form of dual porosity or layering. Finally, when generated with computer assistance, the type-curve family can account for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during the transient data acquisition. Originally, type-curve families were printed on specialized (usually log-log) coordinates with dimensionless parameters defining the x and y axes. Today, commercial software can generate the type-curve families on the computer screen, enabling a much more flexible and user-friendly analysis. Further, automated regression (usually least squares) permits an optimized match between the acquired data and a selected model. Type curves have greatly enriched the ability of interpreters to extract potential explanations for transient data trends that differ from the radial-flow behavior required for conventional semilog (Horner buildup) analysis.",type curves

Reservoir Characterization,"A quantum-mechanical principle formulated by German physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg. It proposes that measuring either one of two related quantities, such as position and momentum, or energy and time, produces uncertainty in the measurement of the other. The error in measurement of one (for example, position) times the error in measurement of the other (for example, momentum) must be greater or equal to Planck's constant. This principle accounts for bizarre behavior of subatomic particles and implies that we can never know everything exactly.",uncertainty principle

In the pressure falloff method, the sample is at atmospheric pressure, either in a chamber or under a probe. Fluid at a higher pressure is released into one end of the sample. The decay of pressure with time at that end of the sample is recorded and analyzed by techniques similar to those used for transient well tests. In the pulse-decay method, the sample is held in a chamber and connected to two reservoirs, all of which are filled with a fluid at high pressure. The pressure in one of the reservoirs is increased a small amount and then re-connected to the sample.

Production Logging,"A device for measuring the internal diameter of a casing, tubing or open borehole using high-frequency acoustic signals. A transducer (in transmit mode) emits a high-frequency pulse that is reflected by the pipe or borehole wall back to the transducer (in receive mode). The diameter is determined from the time of flight of this echo and the fluid acoustic velocity. The transducer is rotated to produce a cross section of the borehole size and full-coverage images of the borehole wall. The measurement has high resolution and is used to detect deformations, the buildup of scale, or metal loss due to corrosion. The amplitude of the echo from the inner casing surface provides qualitative information on the state of the surface, such as rugosity or corrosion. Casing thickness may also be measured simultaneously, either by analysis of the casing resonance signal, or by detecting separately the echoes from the inner and outer casing surfaces.",ultrasonic caliper

This crossflow from one zone to another can occur when a high-pressure zone is encountered, the well flows, and the drilling crew reacts properly and closes the blowout preventers (BOPs). Pressure in the annulus then builds up to the point at which a weak zone fractures. Depending on the pressure at which the fracturing occurs, the flowing formation can continue to flow and losses continue to occur in the fractured zone. Underground blowouts are historically the most expensive problem in the drilling arena, eclipsing the costs of even surface blowouts.

Production Logging,"A method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used. Velocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 B/D [16m3/d]. They are not usually run in production wells because of problems of tracer disposal. In multiphase flow, the tracer most often travels with the continuous phase, thereby giving a type of phase-velocity log.",velocity shot measurement

Formation of miscibility may require several contacts between gas containing vaporized components and fresh reservoir oil. If the injected gas becomes sufficiently enriched with these components that miscibility results with the oil, then the lean gas and oil have multiple-contact miscibility.

The vee-door is really a hole and has no true door that can be closed or locked, so inexperienced visitors to a rigsite are sometimes asked by the rig crew to find the key to the vee-door as a joke.",vee door

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A measure of the effectiveness of an enhanced oil recovery process that depends on the volume of the reservoir contacted by the injected fluid. The volumetric sweep efficiency is an overall result that depends on the injection pattern selected, off-pattern wells, fractures in the reservoir, position of gas-oil and oil/water contacts, reservoir thickness, permeability and areal and vertical heterogeneity, mobility ratio, density difference between the displacing and the displaced fluid, and flow rate.",volumetric sweep efficiency
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"In a displacement process, the ratio of the cumulative height of the vertical sections of the pay zone that are contacted by injection fluid to the total vertical pay zone height. Vertical displacement efficiency (EI) strongly depends on parameters such as mobility ratio and total volume of fluid injected. Nonuniform permeability may cause an irregular front that affects the vertical displacement efficiency because the injected fluid flows faster in high-permeability zones than in low-permeability zones.",vertical displacement efficiency

Among the many vinyl-based polymers and copolymers are acrylates, methacrylates, acrylamides, acrylate-acrylamide (PHPA), vinyl acetate and the various oligomers of ethylene, polyalphaolefins, linear alphaolefins and isomerized olefins. The prefix vinyl is more correctly ethenyl and sometimes vinylene. Polyvinyl is synonymous with vinyl polymers, but not specific to an exact polymer. For example, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl sulfide are commonly used polymers based on ethylene monomers.",vinyl polymer
Geophysics,"A class of borehole seismic measurements used for correlation with surface seismic data, for obtaining images of higher resolution than surface seismic images and for looking ahead of the drill bit; also called a VSP. Purely defined, VSP refers to measurements made in a vertical wellbore using geophones inside the wellbore and a source at the surface near the well. In the more general context, VSPs vary in the well configuration, the number and location of sources and geophones, and how they are deployed. Most VSPs use a surface seismic source, which is commonly a vibrator on land and an air gun in offshore or marine environments. VSPs include the zero-offset VSP, offset VSP, walkaway VSP, walk-above VSP, salt-proximity VSP, shear-wave VSP, and drill-noise or seismic-while-drilling VSP. A VSP is a much more detailed survey than a check-shot survey because the geophones are more closely spaced, typically on the order of 25 m [82 ft], whereas a check-shot survey might include measurements of intervals hundreds of meters apart. Also, a VSP uses the reflected energy contained in the recorded trace at each receiver position as well as the first direct path from source to receiver. The check-shot survey uses only the direct path traveltime. In addition to tying well data to seismic data, the vertical seismic profile also enables converting seismic data to zero-phase data and distinguishing primary reflections from multiples.",VSP
Geophysics,"The rate at which a wave travels through a medium (a scalar) or the rate at which a body is displaced in a given direction (a vector), commonly symbolized by v. Unlike the physicist's definition of velocity as a vector, its usage in geophysics is as a property of a medium-distance divided by traveltime. Velocity can be determined from laboratory measurements, acoustic logs, vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. Velocity can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media such as rocks, and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant velocity (homogeneous) medium.",velocity

Formation Evaluation,"The resistivity of a formation measured by flowing current in a vertical plane. In anisotropic formations, the horizontal and vertical resistivities are different.

Formation Evaluation,"A distance that characterizes the ability of a logging tool to resolve changes parallel to the tool axis. The word vertical implies a vertical well, but the term is used at other wellbore deviations. The vertical resolution summarizes the vertical response of the measurement in one or more distances. Most quoted vertical resolutions assume a homogeneous formation with stated properties. Vertical resolutions can vary considerably in more complex conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. They should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response. There are several different definitions of the vertical resolution distance. First, and most commonly, it is the interval within which a large percentage, typically 90%, of the vertical response occurs. Second, it is the minimum bed thickness needed for the measurement to read within a small percentage, typically 10%, of the true value at the center of the bed. Third, it may refer to the smallest bed thickness for which a significant change can be detected by the measurement. For acoustic and electromagnetic propagation measurements, it is taken, with reasonable accuracy, as the span of the receiver array. For nuclear and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, which must be acquired during a significant time interval, the vertical resolution also depends on the logging speed and the precision required.",vertical resolution

Formation Evaluation,"The response of a logging measurement as a function of distance parallel to the tool axis. The word vertical implies a vertical well, but the term is used at other wellbore deviations. Vertical responses are determined by computer simulation or laboratory measurement. For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the vertical response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the vertical response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted vertical responses have been determined in formations that are radially homogeneous and have small vertical changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor. These factors are appropriate for volumetric measurements such as nuclear and resistivity, but not for others such as acoustic propagation.",vertical response
Drilling Fluids,"A property of fluids and slurries that indicates their resistance to flow, defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate. Viscosity can be expressed mathematically as follows: Poise is the unit for viscosity, equivalent to dyne-sec/cm2. Because one poise represents a high viscosity, 1/100 poise, or one centipoise (cp), is used for mud measurements. One centipoise equals one millipascal-second. Viscosity must have a stated or an understood shear rate in order to be meaningful. Measurement temperature also must be stated or understood.",viscosity

Drilling Fluids,"Measurement of the viscosity and gel strength of a drilling fluid. The gel strength is the shear stress measured at low shear rate after a mud has set quiescently for a period of time (10 seconds and 10 minutes in the standard API procedure, although measurements after 30 minutes or 16 hours may also be made). Viscosity is measured using a Marsh funnel, a conical-shaped funnel, fitted with a small-bore tube on the bottom end through which mud flows under a gravity head. A screen over the top removes large particles that might plug the tube. In the test standardized by API for evaluating water-base and oil-base muds, the funnel viscosity measurement is the time (in seconds) required for one quart of mud to flow out of a Marsh funnel into a graduated mud cup. Funnel viscosity is reported in seconds (for a quart). Water exits the funnel in about 26 seconds. This test was one of the earliest mud measurements for field use. Simple, quick and fool-proof, it still serves as a useful indicator of change in the mud by comparing mud-in and mud-out sample funnel viscosities.

A formation that has 100% clay would have a porosity equal to the wet-clay porosity (WCLP), all of it being clay-bound water, and a volume of dry clay equal to (1 - WCLP). The concept is used to relate the volume of clay-bound water, CBW, to the volume of dry clay, Vdcl, in an actual rock, since the ratio of the two is the same and equal to: CBW / Vdcl = WCLP / (1 - WCLP).",wet clay porosity
Drilling,"To suspend drilling operations while allowing cement slurries to solidify, harden and develop compressive strength. The drilling crew usually uses this time to catch up on maintenance items, to rig down one BOP and rig up another one for the new casing, to get tools and materials ready for the next hole section, and other non-drilling tasks. The WOC time ranges from a few hours to several days, depending on the difficulty and criticality of the cement job in question. WOC time allows cement to develop strength, and avert development of small cracks and other fluid pathways in the cement that might impair zonal isolation.",wait on cement

Drilling Fluids,A fluid with water or brine as droplets dispersed into an external phase of oil.,water in oil emulsion
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Formation Evaluation,The preference of a solid to contact one liquid or gas, known as the wetting phase, rather than another. The wetting phase will tend to spread on the solid surface and a porous solid will tend to imbibe the wetting phase, in both cases displacing the nonwetting phase. Rocks can be water-wet, oil-wet or intermediate-wet. The intermediate state between water-wet and oil-wet can be caused by a mixed-wet system, in which some surfaces or grains are water-wet and others are oil-wet, or a neutral-wet system, in which the surfaces are not strongly wet by either water or oil. Both water and oil wet most materials in preference to gas, but gas can wet sulfur, graphite and coal. Wettability affects relative permeability, electrical properties, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times and saturation profiles in the reservoir. The wetting state impacts waterflooding and aquifer encroachment into a reservoir. Reservoir wetting preference can be determined by measuring the contact angle of crude oil and formation water on silica or calcite crystals or by measuring the characteristics of core plugs in either an Amott imbibition test or a USBM test.",wettability

Well Testing,"The replacement of produced fluids by formation water. Most petroleum reservoirs are underlain by water, and water influx into a reservoir almost always takes place at some rate when gas or oil is produced.

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A type of damage in which the formation wettability is modified, generating a change in relative permeability that eventually affects well productivity. Surfactants or other additives in drilling fluids, especially oil-base mud, or other injected fluids can change formation wettability. A naturally water-wet formation could be changed into an oil-wet formation with consequent production impairment caused by reduction of oil relative permeability. Wettability change is normally treated with mutual solvents to remove the rock-oil coating (asphaltene or paraffin precipitation), followed by a strong water-wet surfactant to reduce the tendency of further hydrocarbon precipitation.",wettability change

Mud weight controls hydrostatic pressure in a wellbore and prevents unwanted flow into the well. The weight of the mud also prevents collapse of casing and the openhole. Excessive mud weight can cause lost circulation by propagating, and then filling, fractures in the rock.

Drilling,"One of the instruments that the driller uses to monitor and improve the operating efficiencies of the drilling operation. The actual measurement of weight is made with a hydraulic gauge attached to the dead line of the drilling line. As tension increases in the drilling line, more hydraulic fluid is forced through the instrument, turning the hands of the indicator. The weight that is measured includes everything exerting tension on the wire rope, including the traveling blocks and cable itself. Hence, to have an accurate weight measurement of the drillstring, the driller must first make a zero offset adjustment to account for the traveling blocks and items other than the drillstring. Then the indicated weight will represent the drillstring (drillpipe and bottomhole assembly). However, the driller is only nominally interested in this weight for most operations. The weight of interest is the weight applied to the bit on the bottom of the hole. The driller could simply take the rotating and hanging off bottom weight, say 300,000 pounds [136,200 kg], and subtract from that the amount of rotating on bottom weight, say 250,000 pounds [113,500 kg], to get a bit weight of 50,000 pounds [22,700 kg]. However, most rigs are equipped with a weight indicator that has a second indicator dial that can be set to read zero (zeroed) with the drillstring hanging free, and works backwards from the main indicator dial. After proper zeroing, any weight set on bottom (that takes weight away from the main dial), has the effect of adding weight to this secondary dial, so that the driller can read weight on bit directly from the dial.",weight indicator
Well Workover and Intervention,"A device or system used to measure, display and record the weight of a tubing string, slickline string or coiled tubing string in the wellbore.

Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation.

Drilling,"Also known as differential sticking, a condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore. Differential sticking typically occurs when high-contact forces caused by low reservoir pressures, high wellbore pressures, or both, are exerted over a sufficiently large area of the drillstring. Differential sticking is, for most drilling organizations, the greatest drilling problem worldwide in terms of time and financial cost. It is important to note that the sticking force is a product of the differential pressure between the wellbore and the reservoir and the area that the differential pressure is acting upon. This means that a relatively low differential pressure (delta p) applied over a large working area can be just as effective in sticking the pipe as can a high differential pressure applied over a small area.",wall sticking
Drilling Fluids,"A situation in which the drilling assembly (pipe, drill collars and bottomhole assembly) is stuck in filter cake that was previously deposited on a permeable zone. The pipe is held in the cake by a difference in pressures between the hydrostatic pressure of the mud and the pore pressure in the permeable zone. The force required to pull the pipe free can exceed the strength of the pipe. Methods used to get the pipe free, in addition to pulling and torquing the pipe, include: (1) lowering hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore, (2) placing a spotting fluid next to the stuck zone and (3) applying shock force just above the stuck point by mechanical jarring, or (4) all the above.

The salinity of the brine phase is an important parameter influencing which type of behavior occurs. To test for the type of system, surfactant is added to an oil-water system. In a Winsor Type I system, the surfactant forms an oil-in-water microemulsion in the aqueous phase. This behavior is not favorable to achieve ultralow interfacial tension with surfactants. In a Winsor Type II system, the surfactant forms a water-in-oil emulsion in the oil phase. This behavior leads to surfactant retention in the oil phase and is unfavorable for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. In a Winsor Type III system, the surfactant forms a microemulsion in a separate phase between the oil and aqueous phases. This phase is a continuous layer containing surfactant, water and dissolved hydrocarbons. This situation is ideal to achieve ultralow interfacial tension values and is favorable for EOR.",Winsor phase behavior
Geophysics,"In digital signal processing, a nonsinusoidal transform by addition and subtraction.

Drilling,"Another term for cementing plug, a rubber plug used to separate the cement slurry from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom plug is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom plug through an increase in pump pressure.",wiper plug
Heavy Oil," Enhanced Oil Recovery,An enhanced oil recovery process whereby water injection and gas injection are carried out alternately for periods of time to provide better sweep efficiency and reduce gas channeling from injector to producer. This process is used mostly in CO2 floods to improve hydrocarbon contact time and sweep efficiency of the CO2.",water alternating gas
Well Testing,"The pressure variation with time recorded in observation wells resulting from changes in rates in production or injection wells. In commercially viable reservoirs, it usually takes considerable time for production at one well to measurably affect the pressure at an adjacent well. Consequently, interference testing has been uncommon because of the cost and the difficulty in maintaining fixed flow rates over an extended time period. With the increasing number of permanent gauge installations, interference testing may become more common than in the past.",well interference testing
Drilling,"An abbreviated recovery and replacement of the drillstring in the wellbore that usually includes the bit and bottomhole assembly passing by all of the openhole, or at least all of the openhole that is thought to be potentially troublesome. This trip varies from the short trip or the round trip only in its function and length. Wiper trips are commonly used when a particular zone is troublesome or if hole-cleaning efficiency is questionable.",wiper trip
Drilling,"An enlarged region of a wellbore. A washout in an openhole section is larger than the original hole size or size of the drill bit. Washout enlargement can be caused by excessive bit jet velocity, soft or unconsolidated formations, in-situ rock stresses, mechanical damage by BHA components, chemical attack and swelling or weakening of shale as it contacts fresh water. Generally speaking, washouts become more severe with time. Appropriate mud types, mud additives and increased mud density can minimize washouts.",wash out

General categories of water-base muds are fresh water, seawater, salt water, lime, potassium and silicate. Subcategorizes of these abound.",water base drilling fluid
Formation Evaluation,"The measurement versus depth or time, or both, of one or more physical quantities in or around a well. The term comes from the word log used in the sense of a record or a note. Wireline logs are taken downhole, transmitted through a wireline to surface and recorded there. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD) logs are also taken downhole. They are either transmitted to surface by mud pulses, or else recorded downhole and retrieved later when the instrument is brought to surface. Mud logs that describe samples of drilled cuttings are taken and recorded on surface.",well log
Formation Evaluation,"The display of one or more log measurements on a strip of paper or film (a hard copy) with depth in one axis. In this sense, the term refers to the display not only of the measurement but of other relevant information. A typical log is presented on folded paper of indeterminate length, but about 8.5-in.

When the term is used in this sense, each log measurement is usually referred to as a curve.",well log
Well Workover and Intervention,A safety device attached to the slickline at surface between the hay pulley and stuffing-box pulley.

Shale Gas,"The description of a proposed wellbore, including the shape, orientation, depth, completion, and evaluation. Well plans might be relatively simple for vertical wellbores. Directional or horizontal wellbores require more detailed planning about where to land the well and begin directional drilling, how long the directional or horizontal section should be, and how to evaluate and complete the well. Shale gas wells, many of which are horizontal wells, require highly detailed well plans to optimize production from reservoirs that are vertically and laterally heterogeneous.",well plan
Formation Evaluation,Related to any aspect of logging that employs an electrical cable to lower tools into the borehole and to transmit data. Wireline logging is distinct from measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and mud logging.,wireline
Well Workover and Intervention,"A general term used to describe well-intervention operations conducted using single-strand or multistrand wire or cable for intervention in oil or gas wells.

Similarly, the term slickline is commonly used to differentiate operations performed with single-strand wire or braided lines.",wireline
Drilling,"An enlarged region of a wellbore. A washout in an openhole section is larger than the original hole size or size of the drill bit. Washout enlargement can be caused by excessive bit jet velocity, soft or unconsolidated formations, in-situ rock stresses, mechanical damage by BHA components, chemical attack and swelling or weakening of shale as it contacts fresh water.

Drilling,"A hole in a pressure-containing component caused by erosion. A washout is relatively common where a high-velocity stream of dry gas carries abrasive sand. The severity generally decreases with sand content, velocity and liquid content.",washout
Production Logging,"A device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid. The term is a misnomer because water cut is not the same as water holdup except in the unlikely case where all phases flow at the same velocity. Since hydrocarbons travel faster than water in a production well, the water holdup is larger than the water cut. However, the water-cut meter was often combined with a flowmeter so that the water cut could be estimated by combining the two measurements.",water cut meter
Well Testing,"The flow rate at which a well is theoretically capable of producing. This is usually defined by a mathematical formula related to Darcy's law, often at maximum theoretical pressure drawdown.

Well Workover and Intervention,"A downhole tool used to cut slickline from a tool string that is stuck or jammed in a wellbore. The wireline cutter is attached to the slickline at surface and dropped down the wellbore.

Well Testing,The volume of produced fluid per unit of time.,well production rate
Well Testing,"Test taken with a wireline formation tester. The wireline formation pressure measurement is acquired by inserting a probe into the borehole wall and performing a minidrawdown and buildup by withdrawing a small amount of formation fluid and then waiting for the pressure to build up to the formation pore pressure. This measurement can provide formation pressures along the borehole, thereby giving a measure of pressure with depth or along a horizontal borehole. The trend in formation pressure with depth provides a measure of the formation-fluid density, and a change in this trend may indicate a fluid contact. Abrupt changes in formation pressure measurements with depth indicate differential pressure depletion and demonstrate barriers to vertical flow. Lateral variation in formation pressure measurements along a horizontal well or in multiple vertical wells indicate reservoir heterogeneity.",wireline formation test
Drilling,"In fishing operations, a large-diameter pipe fitted with an internal grappling device and tungsten carbide cutting surfaces on the bottom. The washover pipe can be lowered over a fish in the wellbore and to latch onto and retrieve the fish. Since the washover pipe is relatively thin-walled and large in diameter, and may be prone to sticking itself, the washover operation is usually reserved as a measure of last resort before abandoning the fish altogether.",washover pipe

Slickline, coiled tubing, snubbing and workover rigs or rod units are routinely used in well service activities.",well servicing
Well Testing,"A tool run on an electric logging cable that pushes a probe into the formation, which then allows production into a small closed chamber. The tool is primarily used to obtain formation pressures at chosen locations in an interval, and, with an accurate quartz gauge, permeability estimates may be obtained. Modern variations on this tool have been developed to acquire formation-fluid samples.",wireline formation tester
Well Workover and Intervention,"A downhole tool routinely used in fishing operations to prepare the top and outside surface of a fish, generally to allow an overshot or similar fishing tool to engage cleanly on the fish. In some cases, the outer portion of a fish may be milled out to allow the body and remaining debris to be pushed to the bottom of the wellbore.",washover shoe
Well Completions," Enhanced Oil Recovery,A method of secondary recovery in which water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil. The water from injection wells physically sweeps the displaced oil to adjacent production wells.

Geophysics,"A type of borehole seismic data designed to measure the seismic traveltime from the surface to a known depth. P-wave velocity of the formations encountered in a wellbore can be measured directly by lowering a geophone to each formation of interest, sending out a source of energy from the surface of the Earth, and recording the resultant signal. The data can then be correlated to surface seismic data by correcting the sonic log and generating a synthetic seismogram to confirm or modify seismic interpretations. It differs from a vertical seismic profile in the number and density ofreceiver depths recorded; geophone positions may be widely and irregularly located in the wellbore, whereas a vertical seismic profile usually has numerous geophones positioned at closely and regularly spaced intervals in the wellbore.",well shoot
Well Workover and Intervention,"A fishing tool used for the retrieval of broken or cut slickline from the wellbore. Wireline grabs are intended to catch and engage wireline that has been bunched or nested in the wellbore. For that reason, they are often run after a blind box or similar fullbore tool has been used to nest the wireline.",wireline grab
Drilling Fluids,"A process in which dirty water is stripped of its solids and made suitable for recycling into a mud system or disposal into sewer systems or other places. In closed mud systems, water containing colloidal matter can be cleaned and recycled. Efficient agglomeration of colloidal solids is achieved by pH adjustment, small additions of alum or a high-molecular-weight polymer.

Enhanced Oil Recovery," Well Workover and Intervention, Well Completions, Shale Gas,A treatment performed to restore or enhance the productivity of a well. Stimulation treatments fall into two main groups, hydraulic fracturing treatments and matrix treatments. Fracturing treatments are performed above the fracture pressure of the reservoir formation and create a highly conductive flow path between the reservoir and the wellbore. Matrix treatments are performed below the reservoir fracture pressure and generally are designed to restore the natural permeability of the reservoir following damage to the near-wellbore area. Stimulation in shale gas reservoirs typically takes the form of hydraulic fracturing treatments.",well stimulation
Reservoir Characterization," Formation Evaluation, Drilling,A continuous measurement of formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include electrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies), sonic properties, active and passive nuclear measurements, dimensional measurements of the wellbore, formation fluid sampling, formation pressure measurement, wireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools, and others. For wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string (link to ID 2964) has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, down log measurements might be conducted on the way into the well, and repeated on the way out if possible.) Most wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.",wireline log

Drilling,"The drilled hole or borehole, including the openhole or uncased portion of the well. Borehole may refer to the inside diameter of the wellbore wall, the rock face that bounds the drilled hole.",wellbore
Production Logging,"A record of the velocity and direction of water flowing in and around a borehole based on oxygen activation. The log may also include estimates of the flow volume and the distance from tool to flowing water. Water, and occasionally carbon dioxide, is the only source of moving oxygen in and around the borehole. Hence, water flow can be detected by oxygen activation, which, being a nuclear technique, is sensitive to flow inside and outside the casing. The measurement is sensitive to small flows, and can be configured to measure upward or downward flow. It is particularly useful as a leak and channel detector, to identify locations of water entry or exit and as a measurement of water velocity in multiphase flow. Logs may be continuous, but the most accurate measurements are made with the tool stationary. Although first tried in the 1960s, the log was not fully studied and implemented until the late 1970s with a purpose-built experimental tool. Standard pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tools were modified to record the log in the 1980s.",water flow log

Well Completions,"A condition caused by an increase in water saturation in the near-wellbore area. Water block typically forms during the drilling phase of a well, when the near-wellbore area is exposed to a relatively high volume of filtrate from the drilling fluid. The increased presence of water causes fine clay crystals that may be present in the formation, such as illite, to swell and cause a reduction in permeability. Water-block treatments typically use surfactants to reduce the surface tension between the oil and water, helping to displace the water from the near-wellbore area.",water block
Well Workover and Intervention,"A production impairment that can occur when the formation matrix in the near-wellbore area becomes water-saturated, thereby decreasing the relative permeability to hydrocarbons. Water block may result from the invasion of water-base drilling or completion fluids or from fingering or coning of formation waters. The most extreme cases of water block occur in low-pressure, low-permeability gas formations, where alcoholic acid systems are recommended because they promote water vaporization in the produced gas. Alcoholic acid formulations are a mixture of acid and alcohol. The acids normally employed are usually either hydrochloric acid [HCl], mud acid [HF-HCl or HF-organic acid (formic or acetic)]. The alcohol is either methyl or isopropyl. Alcohol lowers the surface tension of acid and allows deeper penetration of the acid into the matrix of the rock. Alcohol is somewhat soluble in both acid and water, and penetration of low-surface-tension volatile alcohol into a water block will aid in its removal.",water block

Geophysics,"A one-dimensional pulse, usually the basic response from a single reflector. Its key attributes are its amplitude, frequency and phase. The wavelet originates as a packet of energy from the source point, having a specific origin in time, and is returned to the receivers as a series of events distributed in time and energy. The distribution is a function of velocity and density changes in the subsurface and the relative position of the source and receiver. The energy that returns cannot exceed what was input, so the energy in any received wavelet decays with time as more partitioning takes place at interfaces. Wavelets also decay due to the loss of energy as heat during propagation. This is more extensive at high frequency, so wavelets tend to contain less high-frequency energy relative to low frequencies at longer traveltimes. Some wavelets are known by their shape and spectral content, such as the Ricker wavelet.",wavelet

Geophysics,"A step in seismic processing to determine the shape of the wavelet, also known as the embedded wavelet, that would be produced by a wave train impinging upon an interface with a positive reflection coefficient. Wavelets may also be extracted by using a model for the reflections in a seismic trace, such as a synthetic seismogram. A wavelet is generated by deconvolving the trace with the set of reflection coefficients of the synthetic seismogram, a process also known as deterministic wavelet extraction. Wavelets may be extracted without a model for the reflections by generating a power spectrum of the data. By making certain assumptions, such as that the power spectrum contains information about the wavelet (and not the geology) and that the wavelet is of a certain phase (minimum, zero), a wavelet may be generated. This is also called statistical wavelet extraction. A particular processing approach to establishing the embedded wavelet is to compare the processed seismic response with the response measured by a vertical seismic profile (VSP) or generated synthetically through a synthetic seismogram in which the embedded wavelet is known. The wavelet can also be extracted through the autocorrelation of the seismic trace, in which case the phase of the wavelet has to be assumed.",wavelet extraction

Potential problems associated with waterflood techniques include inefficient recovery due to variable permeability, or similar conditions affecting fluid transport within the reservoir, and early water breakthrough that may cause production and surface processing problems",water flood
Geophysics,"The reciprocal of wavelength, so the number of wave cycles per unit of distance, abbreviated as k.",wavenumber
Enhanced Oil Recovery," Heavy Oil,An in situ combustion technique in which water is injected simultaneously or alternately with air into a formation. Wet combustion actually refers to wet forward combustion and was developed to use the great amount of heat that would otherwise be lost in the formation. The injected water recovers the heat from behind the burning front and transfers it to the oil bank ahead. Because of this additional energy, the oil displacement is more efficient and requires less air. In spite of these advantages, a wet combustion process cannot avoid liquid-blocking problems and use of wet combustion is limited by the oil viscosity. Wet combustion is also called in situ steam generation or a combination of forward combustion and waterflooding, which is abbreviated as COFCAW.",wet combustion
Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A large, empty channel that can penetrate several feet into the formation, caused by the nonuniform dissolution of limestone or dolomite by hydrochloric acid [HCl]. Wormholes are created during matrix stimulation or acid fracturing of carbonate formations. The purpose of matrix stimulation is to create highly conductive wormholes to bypass damage. However, in fracture acidizing, wormholing is a problem, since it is an unwanted diversion of the live acid from the hydraulic fracture system, which causes a reduction of the etched fracture length.",wormhole
Heavy Oil,"A high-porosity, high-permeability channel that develops when heavy oil is produced simultaneously with sand (during cold heavy oil production with sand, or CHOPS). Wormholes develop in a radial pattern away from the borehole and can extend 150 m [492 ft] from the borehole. The development of wormholes can cause reservoir pressure to fall below the bubblepoint, resulting in dissolved gas coming out of solution and forming foamy oil.",wormhole
Formation Evaluation,"A piece of steel cable placed inside a logging head that is designed to break at a predetermined tension. If the logging tool becomes stuck in the borehole, there is a danger that the logging cable will break at surface, since this is the place of maximum tension. It is difficult to fish a long length of tangled cable in the borehole. The weak point is designed to break before the cable, so that the latter can be retrieved, leaving only the logging tool and head in the borehole.",weak point

Production Testing,"Natural gas containing significant heavy hydrocarbons. Propane, butane and other liquid hydrocarbons can be liquefied.",wet gas
Geology,"A type of strike-slip fault in which the fault surface is vertical, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. Given the geological complexity of some deformed rocks, including rocks that have experienced more than one episode of deformation, it can be difficult to distinguish a wrench fault from a strike-slip fault. Also, areas can be deformed more than once or experience ongoing structuring such that fault surfaces can be rotated from their original orientations.",wrench fault
Well Testing,"Water and dissolved gas volume at reservoir conditions divided by water volume at standard conditions. This value can often be neglected, since it is always close to 1.0.",water formation volume factor
Geology," Geophysics,A near-surface, possibly unconsolidated layer of low seismic velocity. The base of the weathered layer commonly coincides with the water table and a sharp increase in seismic velocity. The weathered layer typically has air-filled pores.",weathered layer
Formation Evaluation,"The reactive (X) signal, or that part of the alternating signal at the receiver of an induction logging tool that is out of phase with the transmitter current. This signal, also known as the quadrature signal, is less sensitive to formation conductivity and must be separated from the R-signal, which is the main or, in older tools, the only source of the induction log. In a simple two-coil array, a large component of the X-signal is caused by direct coupling between transmitter and receiver coils. This direct signal is largely eliminated by use of a bucking coil. The X-signal provides a first-order correction to the skin effect of the R-signal.",X signal
Drilling Fluids,"A polysaccharide secreted by the bacteria genus Xanthomonas campestris, also known as xanthan gum. XC in water muds provides non-Newtonian mud rheology, highly desirable because of the flat velocity profile it produces in annular flow, which is required for efficient cuttings lifting in lower density muds. XC polymer is anionic, with tolerance for salinity and fair tolerance for hardness ions. XC is a finely powdered material that can vary in the amount of residual bacteria debris and the ease with which it disperses into water. Temperature tolerance varies with water-phase components, but starts to degrade around 200 to 250°F [93 to 121°C]. Extreme pH or hardness are not well-tolerated by XC polymer and it is susceptible to bacterial attack.",XC polymer
Formation Evaluation,"A technique for the semiquantitative mineralogical analysis of a sample of rock by measuring the diffraction peaks in X-rays diffracted by the sample. The position of the diffraction peaks is a measure of the distance between discrete crystallographic diffracting planes within minerals, while their intensity indicates the quantity of the mineral. The technique is only semiquantitative because the size and shape of the diffraction peak are strongly influenced by the geometry of the measurement, for example orientation of the minerals, and sample preparation. Fine particles such as clays must be separated from larger particles and measured separately if they are to be detected properly. To reduce errors associated with preferred orientation of minerals, samples are most commonly ground to a powder before analysis, a technique known as powder X-ray diffraction.",X ray diffraction

Drilling Fluids,"An aromatic hydrocarbon molecule containing a benzene ring with two methyl side chains, formula C6H4(CH3)2. Xylene is an excellent solvent, especially for aromatic solids such as asphaltic materials. It is used as a solvent and emulsion breaker in workover operations to clean up reservoirs. In drilling mud testing, a 50/50 xylene/isopropanol (IPA) mixture had been used to break oil-mud emulsions prior to titrations to measure alkalinity, chloride and calcium. However, the xylene mixture has been replaced by a single material, propylene glycol normal propyl ether (PNP), to break oil mud emulsions.",xylene

Drilling Fluids,"A term used to specify the quality of a clay according to the number of barrels of 30-cp viscosity mud that one ton of the clay would produce. Although seldom used today, clays were classified as high-, medium- or low-yield bentonites. A good bentonite produced at least 85 bbl of mud per ton. High-yield clays produced 30 to 50 bbl/ton, and low-yield clays produced 15 to 30 bbl/ton. (Note that yield and yield point are not related terms.)",yield

Enhanced Oil Recovery,"A relationship describing the pressure difference across an interface between two fluids at a static, curved interface. This relationship defines the capillary pressure difference at such an interface. (1.) Pc = σ (1/R1 + 1/R2), (2.)

Drilling Fluids,"A parameter of the Bingham plastic model. YP is the yield stress extrapolated to a shear rate of zero. (Plastic viscosity, PV, is the other parameter of the Bingham-plastic model.) A Bingham plastic fluid plots as a straight line on a shear rate (x-axis) versus shear stress (y-axis) plot, in which YP is the zero-shear-rate intercept. (PV is the slope of the line.) YP is calculated from 300- and 600-rpm viscometer dial readings by subtracting PV from the 300-rpm dial reading. YP is used to evaluate the ability of a mud to lift cuttings out of the annulus. A high YP implies a non-Newtonian fluid, one that carries cuttings better than a fluid of similar density but lower YP. YP is lowered by adding deflocculant to a clay-based mud and increased by adding freshly dispersed clay or a flocculant, such as lime.",YP

Drilling Fluids,"A acidic salt, ZnBr2, which is used to prepare dense, clear (solids-free) brine for well completion and workover operations. The density of saturated zinc bromide is approximately 20 lbm/gal, but its pH is low and can cause acidic corrosion and handling problems. Its HSE problems must be weighed carefully against its advantages. Zinc bromide can be used to scavenge sulfides from a mud system in cases where the addition of that salt will not cause detrimental effects on mud performance, such as in a saltwater mud.",zinc bromide
Drilling,"A reduced-diameter section that has been machined at the box (up) end of a drill collar (usually a straight drill collar) so that the collar may be more easily handled with open-and-close elevators. The elevators close around the reduced-diameter section, latch securely, and a shoulder on the elevators prevents the larger diameter end of the collar from passing through the elevators, so the collars can be lifted. If zip grooves are not used on the collars, special lifting subs must be threaded into each stand of collars for lifting, which is time-consuming and less efficient than zip grooves. The primary drawback to zip grooves is that they may reduce the life of the collar by putting an effective limit on how many times the collar threads may be recut.",zip groove
